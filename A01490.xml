            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAuing made readye for thy neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation againſt all contagion of Schiſme, ſo preſent an Electuary, (Gentle Reader) I thought it very profitable for thy better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the eaſier reading of this Treatiſe, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe the of the generall order and methode ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The wholle booke therfore is fittely deuided into fiue partes.

            <p>The ſecond parte, out of Theologicall grounds and reaſons,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> declareth the vnlawfullnes of this kind of Schiſme.</p>
            <p>The third parte, intreateth of ſome thinges an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed vnto this Schiſmaticall action.<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> as daunger of infection: the greeuouſnes of the ſinne, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with other ſinnes: and the neglecting of our dewty towardes our neighbours in the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation therof.</p>
            <p>The fourth parte deduceth out of that which went before,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> that this action was vnlawfull and a ſigne diſtinctiue before any ſtatute of the realme, or late Canon of holy Church: and largely entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the nature and variety of ſignes diſtinctiue of religion.</p>

            <head>AN APOLOGY AGAINST THE DEFENCE OF Schiſme.</head>
            <p>THe firſt degree of felicity (as worthely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth S. CYPRIAN) is not to offend:<note place="margin">Lib. 1. ep. 3</note> the ſecond to know the offence. It is a greate miſery and moſt heauy puniſhment of Gods iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, after that the innocency and purity of an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoted conſcience is once loſt, not to know what is amiſſe: and not feeling the ſmart of the diſeaſe, to neglect the helpe of phiſicke. One of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degrees of pride, the roote and complement of all iniquity, is the defence of ſinne:<note place="margin">Pſal. 140.</note> and with very great reaſon did DAVID aske of God that his hart might not decline into wordes of malice, for to frame excuſes in iniquities. The not knowing of ſinne is ſo great a plague of Gods indignation, that he hath reſerued the ſame eſpecially for the times of Antichriſt, when wickednes abounding,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2.</note> Gods ſeuere puniſhment ſhall alſo match the ſame. At which time as ſaieth S. PAVL, to ſuch as haue not receiued the charity of truth that they may be ſaued, God will ſend the operation of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that they may beleue a lye. So did he puniſh thoſe which<note n="*" place="margin">Eſa. 3.</note> preached their ſinne like vnto So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and were ſo farre from the knowing of ſinne, that by preaching it they did defend it. Woe vnto you (ſaith the Prophet ESAY) which call euill, good; and good, euill: making darknes,<note place="margin">Eſa. 5.</note> light: and light, darknes: making bitter, ſweet: and ſweet, bitter. Woe vnto you which are ſage in your owne eies, and wiſe before your ſelues. Be not<note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 13</note> ouer wiſe, but feare (ſaith the veſſell of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:283:8"/>for<note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 11.</note> the wiſdome of the fleſh is death. The<note n="*" place="margin">Ro. 8.</note> Prophet Ieremy, in the perſon of God propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a queſtion of the obſtinacy of the Iewes, what ſhould the cauſe bee, that hee which was falne,<note n="*" place="margin">c. 8.</note> did not riſe againe, and he which was gone backe, did not returne. But he anſwereth it in theſe wordes: why therfore was this people in Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem auerted with a contentious auerſion? they haue taken hold of a lye, and would not returne. I haue attended and harkened, no man ſpeaketh, that which is good, there is none which doth Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his ſinne, ſaying what haue I done? All are turned vnto their owne courſe as a horſe going impetuouſly vnto warre. The Kite in the aire hath knowne his time, the Turtle, and Swallow, and Storke haue kepte the time of their coming: but my people hath not knowne the iudgement of their Lord. How doe you ſay, we are wiſe, and the law of God is with vs? verely the lying ſtile of the Scribes hath wrote a lye. Thus Ieremy. I may ſeeme vnto you (my deare frend) to forget the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of an epiſtle, and being caried away with the vehemency of an extraordinary greife rather to write an inuectiue againſt an enemie, then in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing maner to deale with an abſent frend. A frend in deed I alwaies haue accounted you, and hope that on my part our frendſhippe ſhall continue vntill death, neither can any thing in the world cutte a ſunder in me, that which w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the two moſt forceable bondes of nature and grace hath bene knitte togeiher. And yet muſt I needs, although with no ſmall diſcontment of my owne, accuſe here your vnfaithfulnes, as well towardes my ſelfe,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:283:8"/>as alſo towards God in both reſpectes if they be ſufficiently waighed, &amp; not according to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt indgement of worldly affection: you haue miniſtred not a litle matter of iuſt ſuſpicion, leaſt our frendſhip ſhould not be perpetuall. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect charity of a Chriſtian to any other, is founded in that capacity which euery one hath of eternall felicity: and therfore we muſt loue ſo long as this life laſteth, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſtian charity, the moſt deſperate ſinner in the world: for ſo long as he here liueth, he is not out of poſſibility of ſaluation. But if that death which depriueth him of bodily life and ſenſe doe entrap him either vnready or careleſſe of that bliſſe for which he was created: then as he ſalleth into eternall miſeries: ſo is he cut off from all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of whoſoeuer is the child of God, and no more to be beloued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lucifer. You haue ſought of late to enter into frendſhip with this worlde, you haue eſtemed your worldly riches more then God, you haue moſt baſely denied him before men: what can you now expect, but that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your ſelfe the<note n="*" place="margin">Iac. 4.</note> enemy of God, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnworthy of him, and euen now already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied of Chriſt before his Father and his Angells, and except you correct your error) to be before all his elect at the day of iudgement denied for euer? And herin you not only iniured God your creator, but diſſolued alſo the knot of perfect frendſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his creatures: for how can there be true frendſhip, where charity is loſt? or perfect amity, where there is no right of perpetuity? But that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> doth moſt increaſe your miſery &amp; my greife, is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you doe with arrogant defending of your iniquity,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:283:9"/>ſtubbornly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſtand al helpes of your recouery. You are anerted as the Prophet ſaith) w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a contentious auerſion, you haue taken hold of a lye, yea you haue of your ſelfe taken vpon you the office of a Scribe, and being your owne counſailor, with a moſt lying penne haue ſet downe vnto your ſelfe a moſt perniciouſe vntruth. The holy Patriach IOB very particulerly deſcribing the properties of the Diuell in the figure of LEVIATHAN,<note place="margin">Iob. 14.</note> ſaith that his body is as it were targettes of melted met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, compact of ſcales ioining together. One is lincked vpon an other, &amp; not ſo much as the wind can get betweene them. One will cleaue vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and holding faſt them ſelues they will not be ſeuered.<note place="margin">Greg l. 33. mor. c. 30.</note> 
               <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> What is this body of the Diuell (Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don I pray you, my true, but frendly ſpeaches) but your ſelfe and ſuch others, as hauing ſeuered your ſelues from the vnity of Chriſts, body, are now incorporate vnto the monſter LEVIATHAN? You therfore are become a braſen targette, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt with the hardnes of your hart, you driue backe the arrowes of holſome counſell, and with the ſcales of ſophiſticall reaſons, you beare off the fruit full dint of Gods inſpirations Neither are you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with your owne ſtubbornenes, but (as God hath giuen you many ſinguler talents, more fitte to be conuerted to better vſes) you haue lincked vnto your ſelfe the iniquity of others, therby to confirme your owne, and keepe away the ſacred counſaile of godly inſtructions from your brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; leaſt by their recouery, either your pleaſant malady ſhould be cured, or your ſtifnecked iniquitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Wherin alſo as your wholle euill doth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:283:9"/>come from this, that you haue receiued the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration<note n="*" place="margin">2. Theſ. 2</note> of errour for to beleeue a lye: So doe you moſt manifeſtly imitate the father of lies, who from the begining doth nothing but lye: I meane that LEVIATHAN of which I ſpoke before, who contenting not himſelfe with his own ruine, abuſed the excellency of his moſt bewtifvll nature, to the drawing of the third part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtarres<note n="*" place="margin">Apoc. 12.</note> of hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen into the like deſtruction. How vnlike are you, I pray you, vnto this Dragon, who abuſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny giftes of learning and nature, not only to ſinne in the ſight of the wholle world; therby to giue euill example: nor to defend your ſinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſo to peruert the vnderſtanding of many: but alſo by earneſt perſuaſions and buſie diuulging of your euil hatched opinions, to allure your acquain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance to ſo ſinfull imitation. It is a miſerable thing to ſinne, ſo to loſe Gods fauour: worſe to ſinne openly, ſo to giue a ſcandall: more abhominable to defend your ſinne, ſo to refuſe repentance: But moſt horrible, with the filth of ſinne, reproch of ſcandall, obſtinacy of a proude minde erected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and his holy ſpirite, to cauſe directly the fall of a number. The damned reprobate ſoules although in hell they haue no good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all, but rather a deſire of all iniquity: yet haue they a certaine horror of cauſing the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of others: as may appeare by the rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who knowing how much his torment ſhold increaſe by the coming to hell of his wicked bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whom he had with euill example corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: not of charity towards them, but of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall loue to himſelfe deſired to preuent their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:283:10"/>What may in the like caſe a Chriſtian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, who directly fighting againſt Chriſt, ſeeketh to perſwade that which he diſſwaded, trauaileth to pull downe that which he builded, cauſeth that to periſh for which he ſuffered? This is your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate (my deare frend) whileſt you ſeeke not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to abound in your owne ſenſe, as S. PAVL teacheth: but by your owne vnſound and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgement, condemne and deſpiſe the wholle conſent and autority of holy Church. But what reaſon haue you leaſt you may ſeeme without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to goe mad for to defend either your faithleſſe practiſe, or wicked doctrine of going to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church with heretickes? You haue as you write vnto me, two kind of argumentes: the one conſiſteth in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority the other in reaſons. Let vs examine theſe groundes, let vs waigh your proofes, if perhappes you may riſe againe from your impiety. I ſaye (if perhappes) for wheras from the dead as from one which is not (as ſaieth the wiſe man) confeſſion periſheth:<note place="margin">Eccli. 17.</note> you which by defence of your ſinne doe ſhut vp the only welſping of Gods grace, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing and acknowleging the ſame: muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be dead and ſo ouerwhelmed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> earthly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations, that without his call who raiſed Lazarus you cannot be reuiued.</p>

               <p>Now for the diſpenſation:<note place="margin">That the Pope hath not diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> I ſee not how if ther were any, it could auaile you, conſidering the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of diſpenſations from Rome in our countrey: and that although you would neuer ſo carefully conceale it, yet you might hereafter be put to your othe, whether you went to the Church vpon any diſpenſation or tolleration from Rome, or no. But let vs ſcanne the truth of this diſpenſation. When was it graunted? by whom? in what forme, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? how paſſed it the Alpes, without our priuitie in theſe countries? why are not the Preiſtes there with you made priuy thereunto, conſidering that the<note n="*" place="margin">Mal. 2.</note> lippes of the Preiſtes doe keepe knowledge, &amp; men muſt require the law out of their mouth? what ſubordination is there kept, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch things are ſent vnto lay-men and not vnto the Paſtours &amp; teachers of your ſoules? why doe we not in theſe countries informe thoſe which come out of the Seminaries of this enlargement? muſt a few vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, timerous, inconſtant lay-men (and ſuch as your ſelfe are for I meane not all) be the Popes Agentes in ſo waighty matters, to haue the diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of them in the Realme?

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:283:11"/>define or diſpenſe in a thing which hee had no Diuines to maintaine. It may be that he define a thing which hath bene doubtfull among Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,<note place="margin">The Pope neuer defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſeth, contrary to common doctrine of Diuines.</note> or that he diſpenſe in a thing which ſome affirme; others deny to be diſpenſable, as we know he practiſeth in diſpenſing in ſome kind of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: But this is ſuch a point, ſo neceſſarily dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of Gods word, ſo confirmed by the practiſe of all ages, ſo reſolued in all learned mens iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world: that I aſſure you, whoſoeuer taking vpon him the name of a Diuine, ſhould propound it as a doubtfull or diſputable queſtion (I meane practically, and not onely as to exerciſe mens wittes, in diſputing of very reſolued caſes:) in any vniuerſity of the world, he would be hiſſed at: much leſſe it is to be thought that the Pope would diſpenſe in it.</p>
               <p>Yea this I ſay vnto you and am moſt aſſured of,<note place="margin">The Pope cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe in this caſe.</note> that although this point of going to the Church with heretickes were only by poſitiue lawes forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den (as vndoubtedly it is of the owne nature and by Gods law vnlawfull, as ſhall be ſhewed hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) yet the caſe ſo ſtandeth in England that he can not diſpenſe in it. For the action of going to the Church,<note place="margin">going to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church is exacted for contempt of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (beſide many other reaſons) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable.</note> is alwaies exacted in contempt of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke religion, as appeareth both by the vſages of thoſe poore ſoules which in ſome partes before the late Commiſſioners relenting, were with ſinguler deſpite and barbarous vſages by the officers driuen to the Church; and alſo by the ordinary ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which at the Aſſiſes diuers haue pronounced, when they haue become conformable, wherin the principall pointes of Catholicke religion are renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:283:12"/>So that I know who purpoſely comming to the Aſſiſes to ſubmitte him ſelfe, by hearing his fellow before him to make ſo ſhamefull a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, which alſo very contemptuonſly ſome are like grammer ſchollers commaunded to repeate againe, as not hauing pronounced it well, or not ſpoken loud enough: this man, I ſay, perceiuing more to be exacted then he had ſtomacke to beare withdrew himſelfe and abode the aduenture of the law. And although all which yeeld to goe to the Church doe not make this ſubmiſſion: yet hereby may we ſee that the intent of going to the heretickes ſeruice, is ſo to obey the Prince, that Gods Church and autority may be contemned.</p>
               <p>Now therfore the Pope cannot diſpenſe in the breach of his owne law,<note place="margin">The Pope cannot diſpenſe in the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of his owne lawe.</note> when it is exacted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. For than is not his owne law onely broken but alſo Gods: who ſaieth,<note n="*" place="margin">Luc. 10</note> he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me. So that if the Pope hauing excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated one of thoſe Emperours with whome he had in times paſt ſo great contention, ſhould fall into the ſaid Emperours handes, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſhould ſay vnto him, thou haſt excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated me &amp; therfore to Preiſt will ſay Maſſe in my preſence: But in deſpite of thee I will make thy ſelfe ſay Maſſe before me. In this contempte although the Emperour be excommunicate only by the Popes own decree: yet if the Pope celebrate, he ſinneth mortally. Euen ſo although this were a poſitiue law of not going to the Church with heretickes, yet if you be commaunded of purpoſe to doe contrary vnto ſuch law: by doing it, you ſinne mortally; neither can the Pope diſpenſe that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:283:12"/>his owne autority be had in contempt. This is the common doctrine both in matters of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications,<note n="*" place="margin">Caiet. ver. contem. &amp; verbo. In Feſto licita.</note> which are poſitiue, and alſo in working of holy daies, w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> alſo (at the leaſt beſides Sonday) are poſitiue. So that although vpon neceſſity one may worke vpon ſuch a daye, yet were it a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne, if euen with danger of death he wrought at his Lords commaundement, for deſpite of the Church or contempt of that particuler law. And the like is in diuerſe caſes.</p>

               <p>To this I can ſay nothing more, then I haue ſaid before of the reſt: but that you may doe well to counſaile all Recuſants which haue hitherto paied the ſtatute, or otherwiſe forfeited any thing for their recuſancy, to chalenge of him a ful reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all their damages.

For I am very credibly giuen to vnderſtand, that there is not one Catholike Preiſt in England, who differeth from the reſt of his brethren (one only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) of whom I heare that no good and godly perſon maketh any accounte at all, leaſt perhaps the miniſteriall ſpirite of pride, which muſt needes haue bene once in him before he was a Catholike, ſhould returning vnto his former houſe make the laſt things worſe then the former. eſpecially wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I vnderſtand that the Superiours of Rhemes, hearing of his doings, ſent word to all other Preiſts by one coming vnto you: that they ſhould not feede his contentiouſe humour by writing againſt him, but account him rather as a heathen and Publicane. And diuerſe of our countrey-men are here reſolued, that he will be very ſhortly ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his ſinguler &amp; perniciouſe doctrine. This
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:283:13"/>alſo I am aſſured of, that a certaine other Preiſt, who in England hauing committed vnto writing ſome fantaſticall conceites of his owne concerning this point, not finding ſufficient credit at home, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Rome whence he firſt came, with his conceited writinges: there freely and voluntarily making an humble ſubmiſſion and reuoking his dreames, burned his papers. and I heare alſo that for deſire of perfect ſatisfaction for his former ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and errour, he went after his returne into England to the aforeſaid Preiſt, of whoſe opinion before his departue he had known nothing at all: and informed him very charitably of the effect of his iorney. But very likely it is that he auailed litle. Yet this I do vnderſtand that ſince his returne from Rome this Preiſt behaued him ſelfe very well in England before his impriſonment (for now they ſay here, he is in Bridewell) far contrary to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite they had of him with vs. For this I know that at Rome to hinder his returne vnto you, and to preuent the returne vnto his vomitte which was feared, they would haue either kept him as priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or proceeded with him euen ſo farre as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, if it had not bene feared leaſt it would haue ſcandalized the countreis there, &amp; diſcouered too much vnto them the imperfections of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in the low countrey he ſhould haue bene detained by force, if they could haue found of charity who would haue diſcharged his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. But thankes be to God he hath behaued himſelfe otherwiſe then we looked for. God grant that in priſon he be the ſame which he was abrod. It would alſo haue beſeemed any humble ſpirite,

Firſt the 12.<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> Fathers of the Councell of TRENT whoſe learned iudgement in this point is yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Neither ought it to be called in to ſuſpicion becauſe it was not generally ſet downe. For both there are ſufficient witneſſes aliue for the verity therof, and it was our owne ſuite to haue it done couertly, and perhappes it was a queſtion vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of publicke diſcuſſion, none but a few time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſe Catholickes of a ſmall corner of the worlds
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:283:14"/>calling it into doubt. For in hereticks iudgementes againſt whom the Councell was gathered the caſe was moſt cleare &amp; euident: that a man may not go to the congregations of a contrary religion, and other very waighty matters were put ouer to diuers Deputies: as the correcting of the Miſſall and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiarye, the cenſure of bookes forbidden, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeeing of the text of ſcripture, the making of a Cathechiſme for Paſtours and other like.

               <p>Secondly I bring the autority of ſo many Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and learned Biſhopps and Prelates,<note place="margin">The aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Clergies doctrine &amp; example w<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the example alſo of the Laity.</note> as at the beginning of this ſchiſme did both refuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; and induce others to refuſe ſuch participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with heretikes. For all the world can very well teſtifie, that from the very begining there haue bene diuerſe lay-men who haue refuſed. and it is a childiſh diſtinction of ſay that thoſe firſt Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers thought that to go to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church was lawfull for lay-men and not for the clergye. To this I add that one of them wrote a learned booke of the ſame argument: and when they beganne more dilligently to looke into the matter, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted none to Maſſe or Sacraments which did not fully determine to auoide the prophane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenticles of heretickes.

               <p>Thirdly of thoſe which for the confeſſion of theire faith did leaue their countrey:<note place="margin">The bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours and Diuines.</note> certaine it is that not one was doubtfull in this queſtion: that you may ſee this to be no Seminary reſolution. For one of the moſt principall of that company in the preface aſa booke yet extant of Images, doth ſo fully and learnedly diſcourſe therof, that a ſincere vnderſtanding can require no more. And this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſince the yeere 64 which is almoſt 30 yeeres ſince. And he complaineth not a litle of the foule ouerſight which was in the clergy, not to controle at the firſt ſo vnlawfull an action.

               <p>Your firſt reaſon is the example of the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren W<hi rend="sup">c</hi> in Babilon were preſent at the ſolemne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Nabuchodonoſors Idoll although they kneeled not downe to worſhippe the ſame.<note place="margin">The 4. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the children in Babilon.

To which I anſwere. Firſt, that their preſence onely in that place was not religiouſe or ceremoniouſe. for the ceremony of religion beganne onely in the proſtration vnto the Idoll: at which time they were ſufficiently diſcerned from the others by their ſtanding vp: wherby they ſhewed the contempte therof, and no way ſatisfied the precept of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:283:16"/>ſuch a thing to be intended, with great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection come thither, and preſent themſelues vnto ſuch Martyrdome as was to enſew. But our caſe and theirs is not alike: for the very preſence at ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice with heretickes is religiouſe, neither is there any thing required of whoſoeuer is moſt deuoutly and willingly preſent, but to be in that place in an orderly manner. And this in Catholicke religion alſo is accounted a participation IN DIVINIS. to be preſent in the place. So that he which is at Maſſe where an excommunicate perſon heareth Maſſe, is alwaies iudged to participate W<hi rend="sup">c</hi> the ſame. this being in Chriſtian religion the nature of all ſacred actions, that the laye people are as it were patients, that is, doe nothing ſolemnlye, but all action appertaineth to the clergy, to whome it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to purge, illuminate and make perfect, as both out of<note n="*" place="margin">ad hebr. 10</note> S.

The like vnto the caſe of the three children were if that in England there were a proclamation that ſuch a day euery one ſhould repaire vnto the markette towne there in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kette place to ſubſcribe. Now ſome Catholicke
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:283:16"/>perhaps will no come at all. Others for a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of ſhewing their religion, &amp; no way to colour theſelues, knowing what the euent will be, come thither: and all the reſt ſubſcribing refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. whether parte thinke you hath donne bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? the one, which hath auoided, or the other, which hath perfectly ſought to viter his profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Neither muſt you thinke that he which ſhould be preſent at hereticks ſeruice and refuſe to receiue, had donne like the three children: for he hath in one thing denied, and in the other confeſſed his faith. and we may not doe euill that good may enſew. Theſe children did nothing but in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was religiouſe plainly ſhew their vncorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted faith.</p>
               <p>Now if you reply: that ſuppoſing they knew before that Idolatry was there to be practiſed,<note place="margin">A replye.</note> then conſequently they committed an vnlawfull action in giuing the world to vnderſtand that they wolde doe that which was vnlawfull: After which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we condemne ſuch as ſay they will goe to the Church, although they goe not in deed nor intend to goe:<note place="margin">The anſwer</note> I anſwere that humane actions are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the end. And ſo long as the meanes for that end be indifferent, and may be referred as well to a lawfull as to an vnlawfull end: we may permitte euen in matters of faith the wrong vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the beholders. Yet ſo that if wee may ſeeme to geue probable occaſion of denying our faith, if the end doe not preſently follow which we intended than we fatisfie our neighbour by open meanes and declaration of our firſt purpoſe. For example if one intend to goe to preach catholickly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:283:17"/>in an hereticall Church,<note place="margin">Whether a Catholicke P. may goe to preach in the Church</note> the meanes hereunto, are firſt to goe that way which leadeth to the Church: than to goe into the Church, and ſo ſtraight into the pulpitte theſe thinges being indifferent, and the declaring of his purpoſe being ready to enſew: this man is not to be condemned, and if he ſhold meete one which knew him, he might ſay that he was going to the Church. for although this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were vnlawfull alone by it ſelfe: yet being ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with many other actions which concurre to make but one wholle action, it is no more a deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of his faith than if a man making profeſſion of his faith, in one ſentence ſhould haue the one halfe ſound heretically which by one worde enſueing immediately is turned to a lawfull ſenſe. For as a mans meaning is not to be gathered by halfe a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: ſo neither is it by halfe an action; when the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> action is not morally interrupted. yet if this man were hindered of his purpoſe ſo that he were not permitted to preach: then were he bound to certe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye thoſe which ſaw him, and knew that he went to the Church, of his iuſt determination. And yet were it vnlawfull for ſuch a one to be in ſuch maner preſent before his ſermon that he mighte ſeeme to participate with them in any parte of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: as if they ſong a pſalme at the begining, at which he ſhould make no ſhew of diſtinction. for theſe are not indifferent meanes for his end, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may he doe euill that good may follow.</p>
               <p>But if any Catholicke priuye to his intention ſhould goe thither for to heare him:<note place="margin">In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olicke may goe to heare ſuch a Preacher.</note> he ſhoulde vndoubtedly ſinne, if he were ſo preſent, that his being there were not knowne to be no more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:283:17"/>or fauourable then the preachers. For the preachers preſence is ſufficiently ſhewed for what end it is: but ſo is not the others, but all the reſt of the company is eſteemed hereticall as coming in ſhew to an hereticall ſermon.<note place="margin">An other like caſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>An other like caſe were if one ſhould goe into an Idolls temple when they are preſent at Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and pull downe the Idoll: his going in, would no doubt be lawfull and commendable. Euen ſo ſaye I of theſe children who intending there to make demonſtration of their faith: in an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent action of going and ſaying they would goe to the feild DVRA, concealed their meaning to be vttered afterwarde, when the action ſhould ceaſe to be indifferent, they being religiouſly preſent at no part of the ſame: And if ther were any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſe ceremony: it is like they ſhewed their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like therin, as well as in the cheifeſt ceremony of proſtration.</p>
               <p>It might alſo be that they preſently after theire coming went vnto the Kings commiſſioners to certefie them of there purpoſe, that they would not worſhippe, but cleaue onely to the true God whom they acknowledged.</p>
               <p>Secondly I anſwere vnto the wholle in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.<note place="margin">A ſecond anſwere to the wholle caſe.</note> I ſay that they knew not of any Idolatry to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, or any religiouſe action to be exerciſed, but onely a ſolemne reſtiuall erection or publicke vſage of a moſt ſumptuouſe and huge monument of the Kinges greatnes. And this is ment by the worde (dedication.) For although the Etimology of the worde be taken from an applying or offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or conſecrating a thing to an other, and ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:283:18"/>there is implied withall a certaine religicuſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the ſame, when it is donne to God: yet cannot it here ſignifie any ſuch thing. for if the King accounted it a God as the euent ſhewed: did he meane to dedicate God vnto him ſelfe? or did he meane to conſecrate his God? who would thus conceiue of this dedication? although I confeſſe in prophane writers it is ſo oftentimes taken: yet in diuine ſcriptures muſt we alwaies take the moſt proper ſignification of wordes, whan there can no abſurdity follow. I ſay therfore that the King, although he purpoſed Idolatry, yet by this worde (dedication) did not meane to ſhew his intent: and that the children by the ſame worde, vnderſtood neither making of a God, nor conſecrating of any thing vnto a falſe God, but only a feaſt at the new erection, or at the firſt vſe of the huge and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Image: Euen as at the rearing of houſes, or at the finiſhing of citties and their firſt inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is accuſtomed.<note place="margin">The ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this word Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> This will I ſhew out of the latin, greeke and hebrue word. And firſt for all theſe three languages; the very ſame word which is in this place, is in two other manifeſt places in that prophane ſenſe, which I haue euen now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Deur. 20. Who is the man which hath built a new houſe, and hath not dedicated it? lett him goe and returne into his owne houſe, leaſt he dye in battell, and an other deciate it. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> What other meaning is in this place then to beginne to inhabite the houſe which was lately builded? Like wiſe in the title of the 29 Pſalme we reade thus. A Pſalme of the Song, in the dedication of the houſe of DAVID: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:283:18"/>he built in Hieruſalem, as in the 2 booke of the Kinges the 5 chapter is recorded.</p>
               <p>This being the vſe in the holy ſcripture of theſe wordes in generall: the greeke and hebrue wordes are more indifferent then the latine.<note place="margin">The greeke word.</note> The greeke (ENCAENIA) ſignifieth, properlye as much as (INITIALIA) that is the ſolemne begining or renouation of any thing, the worde (CAENOS) of which it is deriued importing nothing elſe then New. But it is better to heare S. Auguſtine ſpeake ENCAENIA, ſaith he, was the feſtiuity of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Temple. for in the greeke tongue CAENON is that which is new. for whanſoeuer any new thing is dedicated thoſe are called ENCAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIA. now that very vſe hath this word: if any man putte on a new coate, he is ſaid ENCAENIARE. Thus S. Auguſtine. where if we will Engliſh EN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAENIARE we muſt ſay that he which putteth on a new coate doth either dedicate his coate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beginneth firſt to vſe it, or at the leaſt that he ſeemeth in a certaine maner to keepe ENCAENIA or a feaſt of his new coate. where who ſeeth not that there can be no religiouſe meaning in the word? The hebrue word HANVCCHA ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth as largely as DEDICATIO in latin,<note place="margin">The hebrue word.</note> but it is alſo indifferent by deriuation to the begining of any thing. For the verbe HANACH whereof it is deriued ſignifieth to ſeaſon: and becauſe thoſe which are taught the firſt rudiments of arte, doe beginne as it were to be ſeaſoned: hereupon doth it alſo ſignifie to inſtruct. And for the ſame reaſon to dedicate. becauſe that which is dedicated, is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt vſed, and than as it were ſeaſoned. Wherup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:283:19"/>HANICH in the ſcripture ſignifieth a childe taught, wherin no ſpirituall dedication is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and HANICHIM Gen. 14. is taken for new<note n="*" place="margin">The ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which Abraham tooke with him.</note> ſouldiers ſuch as had lately bene trained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to warre, not ſuch as had bene dedicated religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto God. In like maner in the 22 chapter of the Prouerbes where we reade in the hebrew HA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOCH LANAAR: the meaning is not dedicate religiouſly, but ſeaſon or beginne to inſtructe a young man according to his way: alſo when he is olde he will not depart from it.</p>
               <p>But if any one ſhould vrge the word of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Image, for why it was already erected, and there could be no other end now of coming, but Idolatry: I anſwere, that although it were ſette vp before, yet might there be ſome prophane ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity at the firſt vſe therof. euen as at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of houſes, the feaſt is made after the ſetting vp of the houſe. Alſo we may very well ſay, that the ſcripture here vſeth the figure of Anticipation, as in many other places, ſo that when they came togither, the Image was not erected, but it is ſaid to haue bene already erected in reſpect both of the time in which the hiſtory was written, and alſo in reſpect of the time in which they denied worſhip vnto it: eſpeciall wheras it is credibly to be thought that the King after the miracle of the fornance, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Image to be pulled downe: Euen as if we ſhould ſay: K. Henry commaunded all his Lords to come to the ſolemnization of the matrimony of Q. Katherine whom he had maried: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not that ſhe was maried before the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization, but that in reſpect of her diuorce follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:283:19"/>it may be ſaid that he had married her, whom afterward he putt away. although in the greeke and hebrew, this is no more then an ordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terperfectenſe yea in greeke it is the Aoriſt, which is indifferent to any time paſt.</p>
               <p>To conclude therfore aſwel by the circumſtance of the place and intent of Nabuchodonoſor as by the ſignification of the three languages in W<hi rend="sup">c</hi> this part of ſcripture is written, it is euident that the children might and did vnderſtand no Idolatry: and ſo came as it were to a ciuill feaſt or triumph,<note place="margin">A 3. anſwere</note> not knowing what would happen. A third an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere we may giue. that they might of ignorance erre, and thinke that to be lawfull which in deed was not. For not all thinges which are reade in ſcripture euen of Saintes are to be rules of our life,<note place="margin">Lib. de mend. c. 5.</note> (as teacheth S. Auguſtine) but thoſe onely which the ſcripture doth either commend expreſly or lay before vs in them as to be imitated. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple LOT did well in keeping him ſelfe vnſpotted in that wicked citty, &amp; in harbouring the Angells, for which he is in the ſcripture it ſelfe comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Alſo in diſſuading the men of his citty from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting wickednes. yet in ſeeking to deliuer his daughters vnto them therby to diuert them from their purpoſe, who will defend him from blame of iniurye to his daughters? The Midwiues of Aegipte did well and are commended for their pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but not for their lying. IVDETH is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the affection towardes the ſafety of her countrey: yet not by all doctors excuſed from a lye in ſpeaking vnto Holofernes: although her words may haue ſome myſticall vnderſtanding. So per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happs
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:283:20"/>may we ſay that theſe children were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and approued by God with ſo great a miracle for their conſtancy in withſtanding the Kings commaundement: yet is not all their other behauiour therby canonized. Euen as if one ſhold with inuincible ignorance of this our queſtion goe to the Church with heretickes: &amp; yet for refuſing to receiue the communion be hanged: he were a Martyr for his fortitude in the one, &amp; excuſed for his ignorance in the other. Yet becauſe we are not vrged hereunto, hauing two other ſufficient an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres: it is beſt to excuſe them being ſuch ſinguler holy perſonages not only from ſinne in this action, but alſo from ignorance.<note place="margin">A 4. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note>

               <p>Fourthly conſidering what great offices theſe three perſons bore in the kingdome of Nabucho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donoſor, as we reade in the ſame chapter and in the firſt: we may defend their going to ſuch place as Naaman Syrus is by diuerſe defended: of which we will ſpeake hereafter.</p>

IEHV (ſay you) was preſent at the ſacrifices of BAAL, although afterward he killed all the Idolatrous Preiſtes of BAAL. ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may wee alſo for a good end of ſauing our goods, liues, or families, be preſent at hereticall ſeruice.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:283:20"/>
               <p>Now Sir I returne your Argument vppon your ſelfe. IEHV by Sainte AVGVSTINE and all Catholicke Doctours is reprehended for beeing preſent at the Sacrifices of BAAL, though for a principall end of reſtoring Gods Religion in his wholle kingdome: therfore by the iudgement of all Catholicke Doctours you are condemned whileſt you be preſent at the ſacrifices of hereticks, although of your preſence might enſew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of the wholle Realme, much leſſe to ſerue your belly, and to conſerue the Mammon of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. For although there be difference betweene Idolatry and hereſie, and the ſeruice of Idolaters and of heretickes: yet one yeelding vnto an other in wickednes, they both agree that they be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſe.<note place="margin">D.

Theſe alſo are of two ſortes as well noteth Caietane.<note place="margin">Verbo Supſt</note> For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be perniciouſe, or ſuperfluouſe. Thoſe are perniciouſe, which are contrary vnto the verity of faith. Thoſe are ſuperfluouſe, which are any wayes contrary to the cuſtome of the Church, or otherwiſe then the Church doth vſe. The firſt are alwaies mortall ſinnes: the ſecond alſo alwaies, when there is contempt or ſcandall, although of themſelues they were not perniciouſe. Iudge you therfore whether both ſortes of this ſecond kind of

So that out of the fact of IEHV, as you bring an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of going to heretickes ſeruice, becauſe you thinke he did well: So I out of the ſame prooue ſuch diſſimulation to be wicked, becauſe IEHV did euill.<note place="margin">See Aug. l. con. mend. c. 3.

For you knew vndoubtedly that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was not coined out of your owne witte, but bothpropounded and anſwered, before either your ſelfe or your new confraternity were hatched.

               <p>Your next reaſon, is the fact of NAAMAN: who after he was conuerted vnto the true God, yet had (as it ſeemeth) leaue of ELIZEVS the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to be preſent at the Princes ſacrifice vnto Idols The Hiſtory is this: NAAMAN returning vnto the man of God, with his wholle company came and ſtood before him and ſaid. Verely I knowe that there is not any other god in the whole earth, but onely in Iſraell. I beſeech thee therfore, that thou receiue this bleſſing of thy ſeruaunt. But he anſwered. The Lord liueth before whom I ſtand, I will not receaue it. And when he was earneſt, he would not conſent. And NAAMAN, ſaide as thou wilt. But I beſeech thee graunt vnto me thy ſeruant that I may take the burden of two muletts of the earth: for thy ſeruant will not make any

But ſo ſtandeth the caſe with you, &amp; ſuch as you are, that when once you goe to the temple of Remmon, you forget E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIZEVS and the holy land, and the ſacrifice of the true God, and at the very firſt ſteppe into here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſynagogues, as it were take your leaue of all goodnes. Whether this be true or no, I referre my ſelfe to your owne conſcience. But to goe directly vnto the matter: I ſay that aſwell the hebrew as the greeke and latin word, is indifferent in holy ſcriptures, to ſignifie ciuill and diuine worſhippe, and importeth no more then to bowe him ſelfe humbly vnto the ground. which we read in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis<note n="*" place="margin">c. 23.</note> Abraham to haue done for ciuill courteſy to the children of Heth, and in the 18. chapter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did the like to the Angells.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:283:22"/>reuerence to Angells or Saintes. and ſo the common doctrine of Diuines is, that NAAMAN did not bow vnto the Idoll, but vnto the King, yeelding him that temporall ſeruice or eaſe of his body, which was conuenient vnto his Princelye perſon and greatnes: which was alſo the knowne cauſe of his preſence in that place, he being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe knowne to deteſt Idolatry after his recouery from his leper. of which you may reade Lyra and other his companions.<note place="margin">Of going to the Church with the Prince. See §. 5.15. and 16.</note> After which maner diuers doe ſay that for a temporall ſeruice to a Prince to be donne by a knowne Catholicke, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in contempt, or more in the Church then otherwiſe, as to beare the ſword, vphold the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces perſon, or other ſuch like: any perſon who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily is to attend on the Prince, and cannot by any ordinarye meanes keepe him ſelfe from the Court, may accompany the ſame Prince of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary religion vnto the Church: becauſe his going is not as to the Church: neither is he thought to goe to the Church, as to a Church: that is, as it hath ſeruice and communion: but as to a place where he muſt ſerue his Prince with lawfull tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall dueties, ſuch as he were to yeeld him in any other place: And that by this euident &amp; knowne temporall ſeruice altogether void of any religiouſe ceremony (for why he neither kneeleth nor ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any reuerence at all, more than when he atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in other places) all ſignification of religion, vnion with heretickes, and contempt of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieke obedience is taken away: neither is he to be for all that accounted other than a Recuſant. But how farre in this matter one may proceed, I need
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:283:23"/>not bere to ſette downe, for you are no Courtier, and I thinke there be few Courtiers which in this point will trouble you, for counſaile. To whom if they ſhould aske your aduiſe, you may ſay the matter is very doubtfull. wheras many ſay that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIZEVS allowed not his petition, but with a doubtfull anſwere diſmiſſed him, ſaying goe in peace: Seeing perhapps that after the faſhion of courtiers he hearing the truth would not obey it. And ſurely vpon this word the ſcripture maketh no mention whether he went to the temple of Remmon, or no: ſo that his practiſe cannot ſhew vs Elizeus his meaning. But of this place I referre you to the two bookes written in our tongue: the one of ſchiſme the otherof the reaſons of refuſall. Sufficient it is that out of this lace you cannto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerre any formall preſence or going to the Church with heretickes, to be lawfull.</p>

L. 5. c. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But let vs I pray you conſider more deepely the nature of obeidence. Although the very forme and wholle drift of obedience be to doe according vnto the law or commaundement of the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: yet as it appertaineth vnto euery law in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to direct vs vnto all kind of vertues, as Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle teacheth in his Ethickes. (for as he ſaith the law commaundeth vs to doe workes of fortitude, of temperance, and of meekenes, and in like maner of other kind of goodnes or naughtines comman ding the one or forbidding the other:) So is there no particuler precept or law, but beſides the vertue of obedience to it ſelfe, intendeth ſome act of ſome other vertue. Hence doth it proceed, that one w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> doth tranſgreſſe a law, is not forthwith called diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient properly, vnleſſe<note n="*" place="margin">D. Tho. 22. q. 105. ar. 1. ad. 1.</note> he of purpoſe did tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, becauſe he deſpiſed the law: but he is ſaid
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:283:25"/>to haue ſinned againſt that vertue which the law or precept intended. An example hereof we may haue in temperance. The law commandeth that we make but one repaſt on a faſting day. If a man ouercome w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his appetite tranſgreſſe this precept: than hath he ſinned againſt temperance, not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing that abſtinence which the law preſcribed. Neither is he properly in this act diſobedient; but ſo farre as diſobedience is materially included in euery ſinne, which in that it is a ſinne, muſt needs be againſt ſome precept or other. And this is very euident: for two cauſes. For if in euery ſinne there were a formall diſobedience: then could there be but one kind of ſinne in the world, that is of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: and the particuler obiectes of euery ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſhould be but materiall in euery action, as the particuler malice of euery vice alſo materiall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of one forme of diſobedience: and ſo but one nature of vertue &amp; vice in the world. Beſides: one may doe contrary vnto a law, in ſuch a light maner and with ſuch want of conſideration, that he may onely ſinne venially againſt the ſame. and yet if it were properly diſobedience, it were alwaies a mortall ſinne, implying in it ſelfe contempt of the law, which cannot be without a mortall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,<note place="margin">See Caiet. verbo. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptus &amp; verbo Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedientia.</note> euen in the leaſt ſinne of the world, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were but an idle word. For to worke any thing of contempt and hatred of the law and law-makers, cannot be without ſuch hainouſnes.</p>
               <p>Now therfore in euery law there is ſome other goodnes intended beſides the goodnes of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.<note place="margin">No law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth obe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dience only.</note> For when or in what countrey was it euer heard of, that there was a law made for no other
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:283:26"/>end but for obedience? Turne ouer all Brookes Abridgement of the law, looke vpon his titles, goe ouer all your Statutes, which haue bene from time to time made vnder diuerſe Kinges: See whether you can finde any title of any law in the worlde, onely for to be obedient. The law intendeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies obedience in euery particuler ſtatute, and bindeth the ſubiectes to obey the ſame, and neuer doubteth of the ſubiectes obedience, ſo long as he obſerueth euery law, and behaueth him ſelfe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in the common welth: and hauing once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Prince for his ſuperiour, and profeſſed his obedience vnto him, followeth his direction to all ciuill vertues. But that a law ſhould be made, whoſe end ſhould be onely obedience, without anyother reaſon of goodnes, or the breach of w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſhould be onely a contempt, without the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of ſome other vertue, of right and equity towardes the common welth: I confeſſe my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and that I may be deceiued: yet I neuer ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heard or read in any age or in any author. Yea in the holy religiouſe eſtates where obedience is vowed, the ſuperiour alwaies commaundeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule profeſſed, which is for to guide the ſubiectes to all particuler vertues, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the worldly man, not ridiculouſly intending bare obedience and nothing elſe. obedience being practiſed in euery particuler commaundment.</p>
               <p>Than Sir in your ſtatute intituled An act to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſubiectes in their dew obedience, there muſt needes be intended ſome other vertue beſides obedience. For is not the wholle lawe ſufficient to ſhew obidience? or if there were any doubt of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:283:26"/>that Superiour by whom law is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, were not othes of fidelity and homage the ordinary and accuſtomed way to acknowtedg the ſame? or is in this onely act obedience to bee ſhewed and in none elſe? in no place but in the Church? in no maner but by ioyning with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes in their ſeruice? where are ſo many other lawes of eating of fleſh, &amp; of other actions either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded or forbidden, which we know how litle theſe great exacters of obedience doe eſteeme? So may you euidently ſee that it is not odedience only pretended, but ſome other end, ſome other reaſon of that which is proportionable vnto that marke which they ſhoote at, which if you can deuiſe any other then religion, conformity in their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience maketh this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worſe than before</note> contempt of Catholicke vnity: I pray you im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte your conceite vnto me. I my ſelfe can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. wheof I doe inferre that by ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended obedience, this act is made worſe then it was before. For a precept, law, or commaund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment preſcribeth a matter to that vertue which it intendeth, of which it was not a neceſſary matter before. as the commandement of not eating fleſh vpon a faſting day, was not a matter of faſting ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary before the law. for why, one might haue before faſted better with one bitte of fleſh, than with a dainty dinner of diuerſe diſhes of fiſhe. but after the law it is a neceſſary obſeruance, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſcribed vnto faſting. So in like maner, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to goe to the Church before with hereticks had not bene (as alwaies it was) an act of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: now being commaunded by the law, as an act of religion, (for that is the intent of the law,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:283:27"/>&amp; manifeſtly pretended in the one or other ſtatute of going to the Church) it is only a ſimple act of obedience: but an act of obedience in ſuch a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter principally intended, as is the profeſſion of a falſe religion. For euery religiouſe act applied vnto a falſe god, or a falſe kind of worſhip, or a falſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of worſhippers, is an expreſſe proteſtation of the ſame falſe worſhip or vnlawfull fellowſhippe. So ſhould you firſt haue proued this action to be lawfull in it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Obedience is no excuſe but whan the matter thereof is firſt proued lawfull.</note> and then you might haue infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that your obedience had bene lawfull. and you ſhould alſo haue ſhewed ſome end in this law o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and beſides bare obedience, other then the end of religion: which ſurely muſt needes be yeelded to be the very end and obiect of the law. And this, long experience hath ſhewed in the Church of God: that when temporall Princes muſt be obeyed in Churches:<note place="margin">Amb l. 5. ep 33. ad Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinam.</note> there is farther daunger in it then I liſt now to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>But you ſhall ſee an example of Chriſtian obedience. When the Emperour was at greate ſtrife with S. Ambroſe the holy B. of Millan about the deliuering certaine Churches in the citty of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan vnto the Arrians (as alwaies before this feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; abiect age,<note place="margin">Ibid. S Ambroſe his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Emperour.</note> Catholikes wold neuer be found amongſt heretickes in Churches: S.

To the Emperour, Pallaces appertaine: to the Biſhop, the Churches. To thee, is committed the righte ouer the publicke &amp; not ouer the ſacred walles. <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> And when the ſame Saint was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:283:27"/>with death for the ſame cauſe by Calligo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus the Emperours Eunuch, euen in the Church: God permitte (ſaith he) that thou doe that which thou threatneſt. for I will ſuffer that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a Biſhop; thou ſhalt doe that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemeth an Eunuch <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g> In which controuerſie the ſouldiers ſent word as ſaith S.

But that they woulde waite vpon him, if they ſaw him agree with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes:<note place="margin">Trew Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Chriſtians were than Recuſants,</note> otherwiſe they would paſſe vnto that companye which Ambroſe ſhould gather. Such accounte ought Chriſtians to make of auoiding hereticall ſynagogues. I will conclude therfore this matter of obedience with one ſhorte but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible reaſon. You will haue it lawfull for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to goe to the Church.<note place="margin">An inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reaſon, that it is not lawfull to go to the Church for obedience.</note> Than ſay I in this maner.

Where if you had ſaid thus: that you doe what you do not voluntarily: but nothing not voluntarily donne is a ſinne: therfore what you doe is no ſinne: then had your argument bene good but your Maior falſe: for I would then ſay you did voluntarily what you did. But now in your firſt propoſition, where you ſay that you doe a thing for feare and yet not voluntarily: you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude two thinges moſt repugnant in them ſelues. For it is impoſſible that a thing be donne onely for feare and not voluntarily.<note place="margin">Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is done for feare is voluntary.</note> And in thispoint we muſt begge helpe of heathen Philoſophers. For ſo hath feare darckened our countreis vnderſtanding, that the very principles of all morall actions and of goodnes or badnes in our doinges are called into queſtion. For what I pray you? if for feare of loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your owne life, you vniuſtly take away an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe of that feare, haue you not ſinned? If you haue ſinned, then haue you voluntarilye donne it. For<note n="*" place="margin">Aug l. 3 de lib. arb. c. 17 &amp; 18. et lib. de vera rel c. 14. lib. 1. retract. c. 13</note> aſinne is not a ſinne except it be voluntary.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:283:28"/>doe you cary your ſelfe in ſuch maner, becauſe of your feare, that you might not ſtay your ſelfe at home? Surely if feare be ſo mighty a Paſſion, that it taketh away the free gouernment of a mans wil, and not onely threatneth, but inferreth violenc to the outward members: in vaine did our Sauiour exhorte vs not to feare the world, in vaine did he with his heauenly inſtructions animate his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples againſt incounters whatſoeuer of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his holy truth.

For as in a ſtone it is violence to be throwen vpwarde, becauſe it is contrary to the nature of the ſtone which would goe downeward of it ſelfe, and proceedeth from an externall cauſe which is ſaid violently to moue the ſtone: So in a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature which hath to gouerne it ſelfe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and knowledge, whatſoeuer is contrary to the inclination and propenſion of the will recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the ſame knowledge: is violent and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called conſtraint,<note place="margin">The will cannot be conſtrained</note> and cannot be any way vſed but by an externall cauſe.

               <p>Now the outwarde powers of man may no doubt be ſubiect vnto an outward ſtrengh,<note place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde members of man may be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but not by the will.</note> and moued againſt the will. For as Ariſtotle defineth<note n="*" place="margin">l. 3. Eth. c. 1</note> that is violence or conſtraint, whoſe begining is without the thing, the thing it ſelfe applying no endeuour therunto. But certainely we know that a mans hand, or foote, or anyother parte what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, yea the wholle body may be moued by an externall cauſe or begining; the hand, foote, or body, beeing not applyed therunto by the will, which is miſtreſſe of the wholle. And when this happeneth: then doe we ſay that action to haue bene donne violently and conſtrainedly. You goe therfore to the Church, if you go carried by force, pulled, drawne, finally ſo that your ſelfe apply not your members therunto: then was this a violent action againſt your will, and you haue not ſinned. But if your ſelfe once moue your members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,<note place="margin">D. Tho. 1.2. q. 6. ar. 5 ad 2</note> yea ifyou giue an inward conſent to be ſo violented: although it be for feare of loſſe of goods and liuinges: although there ſtand a gallowes of purpoſe erected for you: although the Beadle of Bridewell come behinde you with his ſtaffe, fearce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and barbarouſly threatning you: than haue you moued your ſelfe, the begining of your action is within your ſelfe, if not the firſt motiue, which is outward daunger: yet the immediate beginning and naturall cauſe therof: you apply ſomewhat of your owne, which cannot be but from the will:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:283:29"/>therfore is your action voluntary. For this cauſe doe both Philoſophers and Diuines conclude, that what is donne of feare, is alwaies ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely voluntary. For although in other times or with other circumſtances none would conſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which he doth for feare. yet with thoſe condicions being preſent, he doth abſolutely yeeld vnto the ſame. Wherefore concludeth S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, that wheras euery thing is properly ſaid to be ſuch as it actually is, not as it may be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: that is abſolutely voluntary which is donne and conſented vnto for the preſent fearfull condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it hath annexed, although as it is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined and apprehended without the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it would be reiected. He therfore which by conſtraint is violented, doth nothing, but onely ſuffereth: he which is moued for feare, becauſe he doth ſomewhat himſelfe, is not violented or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained: but the particuler circumſtances conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, doth voluntarily what-ſoeuer hee doth: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though without thoſe conditions it were vnuolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. The humane lawes of diuerſe countreies for that power which the common wealth hath ouer our ciuill actions, doe commonly diſanull thoſe contractes which are made for feare: yet cannot all the lawes of the worlde bring to paſſe but theſe contractes muſt be voluntary albeit the lawe for to puniſhe the iuiuriouſe perſon doth make them voide. neither can feare or any autority make ſuch contract in him which is iniuried to be no ſinne, if it were of it ſelfe a ſinne to make it. You therfore may reſolue your ſelfe that your going to the Church is voluntary. And becauſe euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:283:30"/>voluntary in a matter which of it ſelfe is a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne, deſerueth euerlaſting damnation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be donne for feare: acknowledge your ſinne, that you may the ſooner obtaine remiſſion. And for all this will I vtter ſomewhat more in this point, that you may ſee I conceale nothing which may ſtand for you, that if this action of going to the Church with heretickes were onely forbidden by poſitiue lawes of the Church: than when there were no ſcandall it were lawfull to vſe it: the Church like a moſt kinde mother neuer intending to bind vnto ſo great inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences as in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> omiſſion of the ſame action may enſew.

Wherin I maruaile no more that you are become a new patrone of going to the Church:<note place="margin">This reaſon ſerueth for the defence of all vice.</note> for you haue taken vpon you the defence &amp; maintenance of all other wickednes. Teach I pray you the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer; to haue an intention of ſhewing his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode: the theefe, to deſire riches, that he may liue in his ould age honeſtly and truely in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welth: the adulterer to procure amity and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:283:30"/>frendſhippe in his neighboures ſamely: and then may you vpon ſuch intentions, I will not ſay diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with them, that they may ſeriouſly applye their trades: but perſuade them that which they doe to be ſound and perfect vertue.<note place="margin">Two kinds of intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</note> There be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore two kindes of endes, and likewiſe two ſortes of intentions in our actions. The firſt is an intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecall end, which is the very obiect and motiue which the will deſireth: and that act of the will, by which we deſire to obtaine that end, is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called our intention.</p>
               <p>There is an other end extrinſecall vnto the acte and not alwaies pretended, when we doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire that which is the immediate motiue of our deſire, but referring that to a farther purpoſe, deſire withall to obtaine the ſame. and this is alſo a kind of intention: but extrinſecall and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in our wholle action and is called a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance therof. An example of this you may haue in all actions. If a man determine to go to dinner: the very obiect, and motiue, and intrinſecall end of his deſire, that is of his intention, is to dine. But if he referre this his dinner vnto obedience, or vnto the glory of God, for whom he intendeth to keepe and increaſe hiscorporall ſtrength: theſe are extrinſecall endes or circumſtances of the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or end: and his immediate intention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dine, he referreth the ſame with a farther intention vnto thoſe endes. Now this intrinſecall end which we ſpake of as it giueth the nature and forme vnto the inward action: ſo doth it alſo giue what goodnes or badnes is in it. For if that obiect or motiue be of the owne nature conformable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:283:31"/>to reaſon, than is it a good action or deſire: If con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary; contrary:<note place="margin">A good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſelfe may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but an euill action cannot be iuſtified by good circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances or intentions.</note> If indifferent, ſo that it hath in it ſelfe no certaine or determinate order vnto right reaſon: then is the action of the owne nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, neither good, nor badde. Yet doth not goodnes or badnes flow into an action onely by the nature of the immediate obiect or end of the ſame: but alſo by the extrinſecall end: yea by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumſtance, and euery meanes taken for the obtaining of the ſame firſt end or obiect. So that although the action be good of it ſelfe or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: yet if it be referred to a further end which is euill, or if any meanes vſed for the bringing to paſſe of the action it ſelfe be euill, or there wante any circumſtance of time, place, maner, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure neceſſary: than is the wholle action it ſelfe naught for ſome circumſtance. Euen in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is the action it ſelfe naught, when it being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull is donne with all poſſible circumſtances or intention of whatſoeuer farther good.<note place="margin">Dion. c. 4. de diu. nom.</note> For the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ground both of Philoſophers and Diuines cannot be infringed: that good is of the wholle &amp; intiere cauſe: but the euill is of euery particuler de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Hence is it therfore euident: firſt, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your remote intentions in going to the Church haue neuer ſo great colour of piety: yet that which immediatelye you doe which is to goe to the Church is your intention alſo: And that you as well intend to goe to the Church, although for thoſe extrinſecall endes: as hee which ſtealeth for to geue Almes intendeth to ſteale, and the diſſolute woeman which killeth her Infant for feare of geuing ſcandall, intendeth

Euen as if it were good of it ſelfe, yet might it be made euill by an euill circumſtance. For good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a perfect cauſe, &amp; euill is that which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth any part of the cauſe.

               <p>Firſt therfore by going to Church with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, we meane not that materiall action of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that materiall place where heretickes haue theire ſeruice. For in this reſpect ſuch action is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. Yea in any action in the worlde that which is materiall may be found at ſome time or other,<note place="margin">The materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of euery action may be indiffe rent.</note> and with ſome reſpect vnto reaſon which is the guide of all our actions; morally lawfull and good: though at other times and with other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes it be vnlawfull. For if we take that which is materiall or naturall in murder, which is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaue a man of his life: as it is vnlawfull, when
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:283:33"/>order of iuſtice wanteth: So is it lawfull when the ſame order is obſerued. That alſo which is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall in adultery or in thefte, may be found in true matrimony, or in a mans owne good altogether lawful &amp; commendable: And yet is there none W<hi rend="sup">c</hi> will deny but that murder, adultery, thefte are of temſelues vnlawfull. The reaſon hereof is, for that actions are not morally good or badde but by that conformity or deformitye which they haue with reaſon. Wherfore diuerſe accidents and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny varieties of reſpectes vnto reaſon belonging vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one materiall acte:<note place="margin">The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of morall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, are not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances but eſſentiall vn to the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> theſe are not now in reſpect of goodnes or badnes accidents, but belong vnto the very nature and forme of that acte, making different quallities either of goodnes or badnes: or in the one or the other diuerſe degrees &amp; kinds. For example: it is not a thing belonging vnto the naturall ſubſtance of the acte, whether the man W<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is killed deſerue death, or no: whether it be ones owne wife, or no: whether the horſe be mine, or an others. But in the morall forme and nature therof, that is in reſpect of that conueniency which our actions ought to haue with reaſon: theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions import very much, and belong vnto the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſtance and forme of goodnes or badnes. yea in the very ſame kinde of theſte, as it is not a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance but intrinſecall vnto the thing which is taken, that it is an other mans, when the will choo ſeth and intendeth the ſame: So the difference, of place is not a circumſtance but the very ſubſtance of the obiect; in as much as it is morall, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeth the action ſacriledge when the will determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to take from an holy place. And ſo may we

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:283:36"/>on, when for ſome particuler circumſtance, the ſignification it ſelfe is not taken away, as in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes aforſaid: It is much alike as if a man hanging vpp an Iuye garland at his dore as though he had wine to ſell: ſhould anſwere ſuch as offer to buy wine, that although there be a garland hanged vp: yet he had no ſuch meaning as to ſhew that he had wine: or if a man ſhould with very angry and fierce countenance call ſome perſon of high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty euen before his face, by all maner of opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous names: and being conuented for the ſame, ſhould ſay he ment not as he ſaid.

Wherefore that this wholle matter may be perfectly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: Let vs imagine that vnto AVGVSTVS the Emperour came 4. ſeuerall perſons: the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliouſly, and alſo from his very harte, ſaieth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:283:37"/>AVGVSTVS is an vniuſt Prince. the ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliouſly alſo, although againſt his conſcience, vſeth the like ſpeaches: yet doth he not ſeeke to make his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience known vnto the Emperour, or vnto his courtiers being preſent. The third maketh in deed his mind open vnto his maieſty and court, that he thinketh not ſo vndoubtedly of him: yet contemptuouſly, either to pleaſe an aduerſary of his, or elſe moued with greater feare of that aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary than of the Emperour, he vttereth the very ſame. The fourth not after any of theſe maners, but ſent by a very loiall ſubiect of the Emperours, bringeth him this relation: that a forreine Prince or Lord forgetting his alleageance or duety, hath publikely ſaid of his Emperiall maieſty: AVGVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVS is an vniuſt Prince. Moſt euident it is, that the three firſt hath formally vſed and moſt traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly the aforeſaid wordes. but the laſt only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially &amp; without any crime at all. Now to apply this example vnto our purpoſe: there are three kind of men which wickedly and traiterouſly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God and his Church go to hereticall ſeruice. The firſt is the hereticke himſelfe: who in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both ſignifieth &amp; inwardly meaneth a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion The ſecond is the diſſembling ſciſmatike, who ſignifieth it, and yet in his hart thincketh it not. The third is the ſame fearfull ſchiſmaticke who proteſteth that he meaneth not to ſhew li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a falſe religion, yet neither can his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation be knowne to all which ſee his facte: and perhapps alſo he is not beleeued in the ſame, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he may aſwell lye in his wordes as in his action: and yet (although he obtained ſo much that he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:283:37"/>might be beleeued) cannot be excuſe himſelfe from contempt and derogation vnto Catholicke truth. The fourth onely vſeth the action materially, with out any ſignification of falſhood or contempt of truth at all, as are thoſe whom we haue excuſed before. For as in wordes, which are principally inſtituted for to repreſent the meaning of the hart, there may be the materiall ſound of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſignification, which is the forme therof as when one repeateth the wordes of an other; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were blaſphemous: So, and much more may there be in actions or outward ſignes, which are not ordinarily ſo determined to ſignify, as wordes. So may a man cary an Iuy buſh vpon his backe, home for the fire, &amp; neuer be thought to pretend ſelling of wine:<note place="margin">Bannes. 2.2.</note> And a comedy plaier counterfeite Idolatry before an Idoll, without any formall or ſinfull meaning therof.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Neither for all this is going to the ſeruice of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, not euill in it ſelfe:<note place="margin">All kind of diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this point.</note> For we ſpeake of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their ſeruice formally, that is when there is annexed vnto the materiall therof a ſignification, contempt, or preiudice of religion.</p>
               <p>Finally, hereby it appeareth that wee exclude not any from the ſinfulnes of the deed, who any way guie ſhew, or vſe any kind of diſſimulation in theſe weighty matters.

In reſpect of other vertues: as of religion, which is a vertue to which it belongeth to yeeld honour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: not onely with the mind eſteeming him our cheife Lorde and finall end,<note place="margin">Damaſc. l. 4. c. 13.</note> and ſubmitting our ſelues vnto him as the ſoueraigne ruler of our ſoules: but alſo with our body* and exteriour actions (wheras wee conſiſt as well of bodye as of ſoule) exhibiting vnto him outward reuerence in praier, thankſgeuing: ſacraments and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of religion. Which exteriour actions alwaies being a profeſſion of faith, it is a cleare caſe, that ſometimes in reſpect of religion we are bound to this exteriour acte of faith, which we call confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith. And this bond in reſpect of religion taketh place, ſo ofte as the holy Church bindeth vs vnto any acte of religion, as of hearing Maſſe, confeſſion, receiuing, baptiſme, extreeme vnction or other ſuch like, or when there may happen any neceſſity, either of our neighbour, or of our ſelues, or of the honor of God, or ſinguler co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon profit.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:283:40"/>To this confeſſion we are alſo bound ſometimes in reſpect of charity to wardes our neighbour.<note place="margin">A man is bound to profeſſe his faith for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his neighbour.</note> As whan this is a neceſſary remedy to hinder the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of others in faith and religion, or any great ſcandall in this behalfe.

Saint THOMAS intreating of this matter geueth this rule of the obligation of this precept, ſaying:<note place="margin">2.2. q. 3. ar. a</note> That a man is bound vnto the exteriour confeſſion of his faith, when by the omiſſion therof there ſhold be withdrawen dew honour from God, or profitt to our neighbour: as ſaith he, if any man being demaunded of his ſaith, ſhoulde holde his peace, and therby it ſhould be thought either that he had not faith, or that the Catholicke faith were not trew, or others by his ſilence ſhould be auerted from the faith: for in ſuch caſes the conſeſſion of our faith is of neceſſity to ſaluation.

For ſo is there in all affirmatiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts included alſo a negatiue. As in the precepts of louing God and honouring our Parents which are affirmatiue, there is implied a negatiue precept of not hating God, or diſhonouring our Parents. And as the affirmatiue precepts doe not bind vs at all inſtants to fulfill them: So doe the negatiue at euery moment bind vs not to breake them.

               <p>Moſt manifeſt therfore is it, that ſuch preſence is of it ſelfe vnlawfull, and a mortall ſinne.</p>
               <p>But lett vs proue our Antecedent. Such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is a ceremonious and religious acte, applyed vnto a falſe congregation and religion.

               <p>Further alſo. the Church in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of the keeping of holy daies, which no doubt is a ceremony of Chriſtian religion, doth preſcribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the maner therof, and bindeth vs to no other obſeruance than to be peeſent at Maſſe: at the w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> Diuine Sacrifice whoſoeuer is preſent, although without any attention or deuotion which is dew: yet hath he donne an exteriour act of religion com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded: yet ſinned for want of the inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion which he ſhould haue ioined thereunto. But the ſame is found in the preſence at hereticall ſeruice. Therfore is ſuch preſence ceremonious and religious: Neither can you excuſe your ſelfe with ſaying that you are not attentiuely and deuoutely preſent, becauſe there wanteth your goodwill and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:283:43"/>affection: For there is an inward acte of religion as I touched before and an outward,<note place="margin">Inward and outward actes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the one and the other ioined togither. Now this is an exteriour action of religion although it want the inward forme: and that is the thing w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> we purpoſed to proue that it is an outward acte of religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Againe: in all ſortes of religion there be diuerſe kindes of ceremonies.<note place="margin">Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with other kind of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> Some doe conſiſt in hallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed thinges as Water, Oyle, Aſhes, Palmes, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimentes. Other in time, as in Holy daies, Vigils Faſtings, Lent or ſuch like. And in like maner doth there ſome ceremonies conſiſt in places: as in Churches, Churchyardes, Chappells. Others are found in diuerſe obſeruances, as we ſee were kepte in the ould lawe of MOYSES. Now to vſe the other ceremonies is alwaies a ſigne of that religion vnto which they belong as the keeping of Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, of IVDAISME: the eating of ſwines fleſh, of GENTILISME: the abſteining from certain meates, of MANICHISME: the keeping of the Catholicke Faſtes and daies, of ſome kind of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Catholicke religion: And why I pray you ſhall not the place being ceremonious, with the ceremonious action vſed therin, and the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious time withall, of the Sonday, or holy day, be a ſigne of religion, of that religion I ſay which v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſame,<note place="margin">Ceremonies of places leſſe indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent than others 2.2. q. 85. ar. 3.</note> and commandeth the ſame, and which there as a diſtinct common welth from all others is gathered togither? And this reaſon in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniouſe places, hath more force than in any other ſortes of ceremonies. For as the Diuines doe excellently teach, Religion being a vertew which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:283:43"/>exhibiteth honour and reuerence vnto god, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it happeneth that this vertew commaundeth vnto other vertues &amp; ordaineth their actes to Gods honour: As is to faſt, not onely for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body, but alſo for the honor of God, to geue almes, to pay debtes, to viſitt Pupills and widdowes for Gods honour and ſuch like,<note place="margin">Iac. 1.</note> which properly belong to other vertues, but are by religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it were commaunded and directed vnto the end of religion. But there are other proper actes w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> onely belong to religion, and not to other vertues: Such as haue no other praiſe (as S. THOMAS ſpeaketh) but that they are donne for the reuerence of God. And theſe are moſt properly actes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Of this ſort are ſacrifices, kneeling, knoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the breaſt and ſuch like. Such alſo is this ceremony of going to ſuch a place more than to an other.</p>
               <p>Hereof it proceedeth that one may eate fleſhe vpon a friday or otheer faſting day in diuerſe caſes:<note place="margin">Why one may eate fleſh on a friday, and not lawfully go to the Church.</note> and yet in no caſe go to the Church with hereticks. For to abſteine vpon certaine daies: is not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or immediate acte of religion, but commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by religion, being in deed an acte of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſo intended by the Church: though it may be referred not onely to chaſtice the body, but for to doe an honour vnto God. And becauſe this law is particulerly found amongſt Catholicks: hence it is that it doth oftentimes betoken a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke and diſtinguiſh him from an hereticke. Yet becauſe the immediate end of the law is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and the acte of eating fleſh or other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden meates is ſuch as hath other naturall endes
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:283:44"/>beſides the profeſſion of religion as of feeding the body, or eating with diſpenſation; therfore is there not neceſſarily implied therin any ceremony or ſignification of religion: And in caſe of neceſſity it may be vſed, although others vnderſtand a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of hereſy therin. For why, this act of eating or abſteining, neither of the owne nature nor by common eſtimation of men doth ſignifie religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but hath an other principall vſe. Yet the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church howſoeuer, doth alwaies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token, both of the owne nature and by common ac ception of all the worlde, deuotion and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in Catholicke Churches to the true faith: in hereticall to their deteſtable ſinagogues.</p>
               <p>This doth S. THOMAS (whom I oftener al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage becauſe my conflict is with thoſe which will be counted Catholickes,<note place="margin">2.2. q. 84. ar. 3. ad 2.</note> although in this apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call action, they doe deny their Catholicke religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.) This I ſay doth S.

Thirdly, for the concourſe of many worſhippers, wherby the praier is made more acceptable:<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> according to that: where there are two or three gathered togither in my
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:283:44"/>name there am I in the middeſt of them. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I pray you then, whether this place haue not a ſignification of agreement in religion, and of a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of that religion, which is there gathered togither, I may not ſay in the name of Chriſt, but leaue vnto your ſelfe to iudge in whoſe name. As for the conſecration, you know from whence it came, and how neuertheleſſe they which were the autours therof account it now prophaned. But of the ſacred miſteries and other ſignes of holines, I hope you wil not be very ready to bragge or boaſt: eſpecially when I ſhall tell you hereafter what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of miſteries there be in Proteſtants ſeruice.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Than are you one of Caluins congregation. Yet, that I may doe you no wrong, I will heere put you in minde of a certaine diſtinction which Catholick Doctours vſe: that is, that ſome be of the ſoule of the Church: and ſome of the body. For the Church of Chriſt is not a deade bodye, but a body quickned with a liuely ſpirite. The ſoule of the Church, are the inward vertues therof: the body is the outward ſhew. Euen ſo doe I ſay that in Caluins Church, there is a body and a ſoule: the ſoule is Caluins beliefe, and whatſoeuer other dowry of hell it hath: for this ſoule hath no other place than hell fier. The body of Caluins church,<note place="margin">The body therof</note> moſt fitt for ſuch a ſoule, is the outward profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſhew, or vnion, or practiſe, and ſociety of Caluins broode. Now I confeſſe that one of theſe may be without the other: And as there may be in the Catholicke Church variety of her members: So may there alſo be in Caluins Sinagogues. In the Catholicke Church ſome are both of the body and ſoule of the ſame: ſuch as haue both Faith, and the outward profeſſion of Catholike religion: Others, onely of the ſoule: ſuch as haue not the outward vnion and peace w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God are of ſuch perfection that they be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately vnited therunto by his heauenly grace. Such are thoſe cathecumens, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> abound with loue of God, and trew faith: or alſo excommunicate perſons, not yet reſtored in humane Iudgement, but reſtored before God from whom they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued trew contrition and purpoſe of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment For God is not tied vnto his Sacraments,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:283:54"/>but can, and doth oftentimes immediately iuſtify, thoſe which are throughly conuerted vnto him. Finally others there are which hauing no inward diſpoſition at all, yet either for feare or ſome other affection of worldly intereſt, in outward ſhew doe nothing differ from the reſt. And theſe are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely compared vnto the heares of a mans body, or nailes, or euill humours, which although they be within the body, yet are they not animated by the ſoule, as other partes of the body are, being depriued of all ſenſe, and loſt without paine, and by nature not fitte to be quickned, bvt rather cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine excrementes of the body, onely made to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne and gard the body, and to be vſed by the ſame for the operations of the wholle. So than haue we found out your office in Caluins congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. You are not of the ſoule therof, in deed: For I hope of the former faith, which I know to haue bene perfect in you. But as S. Hierome ſaith, although at the beginning no ſchiſme hath falſe doctrine,<note place="margin">in Tit. 3. Schiſme is the way to hereſy.</note> yet at the length it forgeth to it ſelfe ſome erroneous propoſition, that it may ſeeme to haue gonne from the Church with pretenſe of ſome cauſe: much like vnto your ſelfe, who firſt going to the Church for feare: now that you may purge your ſelfe of cowardiſe &amp; baſenes, maintaine your errour, contrary to the generall ſenſe, not onely of the Church, but euen of morall reaſon. Therfore looke well vnto your ſelfe, leaſt at the length, as the loſſe of charity<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.</note> is the way to the loſſe of faith: ſo your entrance into ſchiſme, make you an entrance vnto hereſy and ſo to a generall ſhipwracke in faith according to the ſaying of the Pſalmiſt.

But yet (as I ſaied) you are not of the ſoule of Caluins religion. Neither are you of the body of Caluin, as a principall member. But you ſhall heare what you are, and I pray you heare it patiently:<note place="margin">Prou. 27.</note> For bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are the ſtrokes of a frend then the kiſſes of an enemy.

And how fitlye is Caluins religion adorned with excrements? For if you take way theſe excrements, or at the leaſt, if ſuch excrements had bene taken away from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining: in Caluins wholle body, there woulde be now neuer a ſound me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber.

Now in that he is an hereticke, your communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him (if we may beleeue your ſelfe, ſaying you be no Caluiniſt in deed) is onely exteriour he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy, as I haue ſaid before: but in that he is a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke, your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication with him doth make you a Schiſmaticke: and not onely an exteriour Schiſmaticke (For in Schiſme there is no ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of interiour and exteriour ſchiſme:) but a very abſolute Schiſmatike.

               <p>But this muſt wee for your better ſatisfaction proue, that it is poſſible to be an exteriour heretike not being properly an hereticke: and yet not an ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teriour Schiſmaticke, without being a very Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke.</p>
               <p>This Argument I can firſt anſwere by an other like caſe. For if you will haue in all vices the like diſtinction vnto infidelity &amp; hereſie, than may you
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:283:56"/>ſaye of a murderer that although he wittingly and willingly killeth: yet he may be but an exteriour murderer and not a perfect murderer: And in like maner of thefte, fornication, and all maner of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge. The reaſon therfore of this difference is, that the vertew of faith, is in the vnderſtanding: for it is a kind of knowledge, which is alwaies in that power of the ſoule, which we call vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: but other vertues of charity, iuſtice, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch like, are harboured in the will. And hereof it proceedeth, that as one may doe an exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour act, contrary vnto his vnderſtanding, but not contrary vnto his will: So may a man exteriourly worke againſt faith, and yet his vnderſtanding not conſent therwith as to vereſie it, although his will doe conſent vnto it as to doe it. for it is the will which hath the rule and gouernment ouer all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions, and they all are ready preſt to worke as the will commaundeth. So than in all morall actions (which muſt needes be voluntary) it is not poſſible that any be exerciſed outwardly, which as being voluntary, doe not ioine with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the inward goodnes or deformity. Euen as in our caſe propounded of exterior infidelity, ſuch outward action becauſe it is voluntary, hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed the inward deformity of the will, vnto w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> it is imputed, although not the errour of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding from which it did not immediately proceed, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which it did not agree, although it agreed with the will and proceeded from the ſame. All this we may plainly expreſſe in a familiar example. One may tell a lye, whan he ſpeaketh contrary to that which is in his mind, and by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:283:57"/>diſſimulation ſhew that, which in deed is not. But yet although by ſuch exteriour demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration he altereth not his vnderſtanding: yet doth his will voluntarily incurre the fault of lying and diſſembling. as in all other outward actions the will contracteth the deformity of them whan they be euill. In like maner may a man tell a lye or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in matters of faith, either by wordes or deedes, as hath bene ſaid: and than although he hath not loſt his faith, by loſſe wherof he ſhould be an hereticke in deed: yet doth he by ſuch lye or diſſimulation ſhew him ſelfe an hereticke, and therfore is called an exteriour hereticke. which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour hereſie being alſo voluntary is a moſt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne. ſhewing that he loueth more the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of men than of God. But in other actions w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> haue no reſpect of conformity vnto the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding which conſiſteth in truth, but onely a reſpect of conformity vnto reaſon and prudence, which conſiſteth in goodnes: there cannot be ſuch diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing betweene the inward and the outward, wheras the inward now conſiſting in the will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which reſpecteth as her proper obiect, goodnes and not truth, as the vnderſtanding doth: muſt of neceſſity participate that goodnes or badnes w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is in the outward. And therfore in our caſe, if ſchiſme be outwardly, it muſt alſo be inwardly. In few wordes wee may vtter this, for the more plaine vnderſtanding of the ſimpler ſorte, in this maner. Hereſy ſuppoſeth an errour in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and therfore he which is onely an exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our heretike without ſuch errour, is not an inward hereticke. But Schiſme requireth nothing but a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:283:57"/>conſent of the will to diuiſion from the Church: and therfore euery outward Schiſmaticke, is alſo an inward Schiſmaticke: as euery outward mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer is alſo an inward murderer.</p>

               <p>Here alſo you take holde of that which we ſaied aboue,<note place="margin">The 14. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. That if it were ſchiſme, all exteriour heretickes ſhould be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.</note> that exteriour heretickes are not holden by Diuines as excommunicate: and yet Schiſmatickes are excommunicate in the yeerely Bulle of Maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Thurſday: how than can it be that you being onely an exteriour hereticke, ſhould be a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, vnleſſe all exteriour heretickes be alſo Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matickes. And than falſe is that generall propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deuines, that an exteriour hereticke on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is not excommunicate: for he is excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for ſchiſme, which we will haue him alſo to incurre.</p>
               <p>This is in very truth the greateſt colour you may haue to excuſe you from ſchiſme, yet, beſides that I will ſhew, that it is but a colour: what haue you gained, whan you haue wonne that you are not a Schiſmaticke? or not excommunicate for ſchiſme? is it not ſufficient to go to hell w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fiue or ſixe mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinnes, except you go alſo for ſchiſme? or to be cutte from the Church by 3. excommunications, except you be alſo excommunicate for ſchiſme?</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe that euery exteriour hereticke be not a Schiſmaticke: are you therfore aſſured to be of that kind of exteriour heretickes which are free from ſchiſme?<note place="margin">Although in all caſes exterior he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks were not Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes: yet in this caſe they were.</note> Heare I pray you what I will ſaye vnto you, in this point: For ſo farre are you from the truth in this freeing your ſelfe from ſchiſme, becauſe you are an exteriour hereticke: that if it be

               <p>For what want you, whan you be among Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſtes of the nature of ſchiſme? becauſe Caluin is an hereticke? he is alſo a Schiſmaticke as I haue ſhewed. Becauſe his ſeruice is rather hereticall the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſciſmaticall, for if it were in deed ſchiſmaticall, it ſhoulde not differ from Catholicke ſeruice? this were trew if Caluin were but in one of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and not in both.

And hath he by being alſo an hereticke, got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a priuiledge, either for him ſelfe or for you, that the filth of ſchiſme is taken away from a farre filthier diuiſion? No ſurely his diuiſion is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, but increaſed: not excuſed, but dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly accuſed:<note place="margin">The 15. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection that it is not ſchiſme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pained w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> an inward deſire of deuiſion</note> not diminiſhed, but exaggerated. Than doth there remaine but this onely defence, that although you ſhould be moſt properly a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maticke, if you went of your owne free will, or with an intention, or deſire of diſuniting your ſelfe from the obedience and vnity of the trew Church, and of the head therof: yet now going for feare, and being in hart and deſire vnited to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke, you cannot incurre the diſunion from the ſame. Here (Sir) I haue catched you: for this w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> you thinke to be your defence, ſhall moſt eaſely
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:283:58"/>conuince you. If you went with thoſe conditions and intentions, than you confeſſe you were moſt properly a Schiſmaticke: as thoſe are which go in ſuch maner.<note place="margin">The exterior act maketh Schiſme.</note> But that exteriour acte is that which maketh ſchiſme, whatſoeuer your motiue or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is: therfore are you moſt properly a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke. For whan is more properly Schiſme in the Church, than whan two Popes are togither? And yet the intention of the Schiſmaticke Pope is not alwaies to decide the Church: but either to be a great Prince, or to reuenge him ſelfe of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or ſuch like: and thoſe which follow him doe oftentimes follow him for feare,<note place="margin">L. 2. vitae. c. 7</note> as in S.

Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard and all the learned of that age eſteemed ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. The like may we ſay of the other ſchiſmes which haue beene in the Church heretofore: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of this we ſhall ſay more hereafter. Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient it is that Schiſme be incurred, that ſuch diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be made, whether Schiſme it ſelfe be directly intended ot indirectly. Much like it is if a looſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious young man, ſhould defile his neighbours bedde, knowing that he ſhall be diſcried, and his lemman be killed by her husband: this man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a man ſlear, although he intended principally the ſatisfying of his filthy deſire. Or if a theefe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Alpes ſhould take away a poore trauailers apparell, wherby the other muſt needes dye for tolde. Or as it hath ſometimes hapned, if a theefe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:283:59"/>by feare and threatning, ſhoulde make one trew man to hang an other or that we may bring Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes example of this very matter.

But of this point of your intention, or of the motiue of feare I haue ſufficiently ſpoken aboue,<note place="margin">§. 10.11.</note> where I anſwered your principall reaſons. This is moſt certaine: that as in all other ſinnes the exteriour action, which is the obiect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour, geueth the quality therof to the interiour, whether ſuch exteriour acte or effect be principally or directly intended or no, ſo long as it is voluntary and foreſeene: Euen ſo is it in this exteriour acte of Schiſme, in which notwithſtanding I may ſay as I ſaid aboue, that whatſoeuer other extrinſecall or remote intention you may haue: as of feare, creditt and reputation in the world, (for this is it which driueth your ſelfe, and many other vnto the Diuell) yet the very intrinſecall end and nature of your action is Schiſme and diſunion from Chriſts Catholicke Church: So therfore although euery exteriour hereticke were not a Schiſmaticke: yet dee I ſay that you are a Schiſmaticke.</p>
               <p>Now to anſwere your obiection, and to ſaue the generall grounde of Deuines, that euery exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour hereticke is not excommunicate: I ſay firſt, that if Caietanes opinion bee trew, who as you know is a Catholicke author,<note place="margin">2.2 q. 12. ar. 1. &amp; q. 94 ar. 1.</note> and of no ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count amongſt the examiners of actes of mans conſcience: than euery exteriour heretike is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excommunicate, &amp; ſo euery exteriour hereticke
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:283:59"/>may perhapps be no Schiſmaticke, and yet be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate for hereſy:<note place="margin">Euery exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke is not exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, &amp; yet he is a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke Bulla caenae c. licet de Elect.</note> or if he be alſo a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke: he may be as well excommunicate for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour hereſy, as for his ſchiſme, Secondly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary opinion, which is of moſt Diuines, that is, that an onely exteriour hereticke is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate: I ſay, that the Churches intent in exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating of Schiſmaticks, is onely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thoſe, which calling them ſelues Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, either make, receaue, or acknowledge vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues a new head as when there are two Popes togither: or thoſe, who making<note n="*" place="margin">Aug l. 1. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.

For it is not neceſſary as Diuines all agree, for to incurre ſchiſme,<note place="margin">Caietan. Bannes. The Pope may be a ſchiſmatick.</note> that the Schiſmaticke make vnto him ſelfe a new heade: for the Pope him ſelfe remaining head, may be a Schiſmaticke, if he ſhould refuſe to communicate with the reſt of the body in ſpirituall thinges: or defend ſecretly or openly ſchiſme: or excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the wholle Church: or alter generally the Apo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtolicall and ordinary ceremonies, rites, cuſtomes, and ſeruices of the Church. And yet in the Pope, this were peculier that he cannot fall into excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, becauſe he is not ſubiect to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes which impoſe excommunication.<note place="margin">Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes are exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate only in two caſes.</note> In theſe two caſes therfore Schiſmatickes ere excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. whan they openlye profeſſe an other head, although they beleeue inwardly the vnity of the holy Church, and of the head therof (for other wiſe they were heretickes:) or when they erect or
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:283:60"/>make them ſelues parte of a new congregation, deuided from the vnity of the wholle. in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes although they be Schiſmatickes: yet doe they not incurre ſuch cenſure. And if you aske me, what caſes theſe are in particuler: I anſwere: that if one amongſt Infidells, ſhould ſaye that Chriſt were not God, or deny for feare, not from his hart any pointe of Catholicke faith: or if in a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke countrey one ſhould vpon any Paſſion, make ſhew of hereſie: becauſe here is no diuerſe head, nor ſeuerall congregation wherunto he may ſeeme to vnite himſelfe: this man is not excommunicate, although he be a Schiſmaticke. Contrary it is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth the ſame, for to ſeeme to vnite him ſelfe vnto a ſeditious head, or congregation profeſſing the name of Chriſt, or publickly ſeuereth himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Neither is this any ſtrange doctrine, that euery Schiſmaticke is not exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate. for who would doubt but that one who maketh him ſelfe a Turke or a Iew,<note place="margin">Bannes. 2.2. q. 11. ar. 4.

Wherin the intention of the Church doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:283:60"/>Church, and ſcandalouſly are wont to breake the publicke peace therof. But ſuch pernicious ſchiſmes are onely in the caſes aforeſaide. Againe, an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke neuer ſo ſecrett, if he priuately vnto him ſelfe vtter his hereſy: is excommunicate for hereſy. and yet I ſee not in the practiſe of the Church, but that ſuch as haue ſpeciall autority to abſolue from here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſye, would not ſticke to abſolue him, for all his Schiſme: which is alwaies annexed vnto hereſy.</p>
               <p>The reaſon her of is this.<note place="margin">why all Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are not excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Aug. l. 1. de lib. arb. c. 5. D. Tho. 1.2 q. 96. ar. 2.</note> for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Church being a certaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, doth not alwaies puniſh alike equall ſinnes: but in ordaining of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall lawes hath a regard vnto that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is perniciouſe for the wholle body: Blaſphemy is a greater ſinne than thefte: ſo alſo is adultery: &amp; yet we know the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are not alike.

The cauſe why the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municateth Schiſmatickes onely in theſe two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, is for that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> theſe two onely the Church hath bene or may be ordinarily moleſted, and generally hindered from her neceſſary peace. Wherfore S. Auguſtine<note n="(a)" place="margin">l. 20. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fauſt. in Tit. 3. vide Cypr. ep. ad Magnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 24. q. 1 c.

Wherunto Pelagius an auncient Pope doth alſo agree: who ſpeaking of ſchiſmatickes; ſaieth, that they haue made to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues partes, and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them ſelues from that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is one, according to the holy Apoſtle S.

               <p>Thus therfore you ſee, how an exteriour here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke doth alwaies an acte of ſchiſme, ſeuering him ſelfe from the vnity of the Church: yet is he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:283:61"/>ſo long as he followeth not, or ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth not to make a parte contrary vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches vnity.<note place="margin">Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in England are excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</note> Than may a man be an exteriour here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and yet not exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate although a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke, yet not ſuch a ſchiſmaticke as your ſelfe, who are a ſchiſmaticke in the higheſt degree, ſaue that you pretend to doe it for feare w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient excuſe to alleadge vnto Chriſt to purge the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding of his moſt indiuiſible holy garment.

The firſt and principall kind of lye (ſaieth he) and farre to be baniſhed from all men is, that, which is made in doctrine of religion, vnto which lye, by

               <p>But howſoeuer it is, I ſay that ſcandall although it may in parte: yet can it neuer be fully auoided. For whoſoeuer is at an heretikes church,<note place="margin">Scandall can neuer be fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoded.</note> although neuer ſo vnknowne ſo that he go not inuiſible, but be ſeene there, by thoſe which are there preſent:) beſides the ſignification of the religion which is there vſed, ſchiſme, diſſimulation and ſuch like as we haue ſaied before: he incurreth the greeuous crime of ſcandall, becauſe he ſeemeth to conſent vnto the wickednes of the miniſter, and his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in that ſeruice. Wherin you muſt remember an ordinary diſtinction of Deuines. For there are 2. maner of conſents. the firſt is conſent,<note place="margin">Caiet verbo Reſtit.</note> which is cauſe of the action: as when I know that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my conſent, ſuch action would not be donne.

As if in Parliament there be a Bill put vpp againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes: and I know that ſo many voices being paſſed already before mine, my contrary voice can not hinder, but it will be made a law: Now if I conſent after ſo many voices, as are ſufficient, (for if I ſhould before ſufficient voices were graunted, the caſe were altered, although I knew what voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were to follow:) than is not my conſent a cauſe of that law: yet is my conſent, a conſent:<note place="margin">Ro. 1.</note> and ſo according to S PAVI. worthy of death as well, as that of the others. In like maner of you go to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:283:65"/>the Church, and the miniſter ſaieth ſeruice onely for you: than is your conſent the cauſe of his ſinne and of the ſinne of as many, as are there preſent: and than, who doubteth but you committ a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall? But if you go at ordinary times, when the miniſter notwithſtanding your preſence, would ſay ſeruice, and others be there without your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement. or any euill example if this be poſſible:) yet is your conſent preſent, and ſo vnderſtood by all men, and therfore is not your action voide of ſandall, but by conſenting vnto an other mans ſinne, you are alſo guilty therof: as a coucurrunt, though not as the cauſe or mouer therunto: as one which alloweth, not as one which comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: as one which geueth the voice; whan the number already is ſufficient to make the law. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any doubt but you may as well geue conſent vnto an action vnto which you concurre for feare,<note place="margin">See §. 10.</note> as if you concurred for loue, as we haue ſaied before.

               <p>Wherupon I do infer two very certaine truthes.<note place="margin">The 16-ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection that temporall lawes or Princes, can not appoint diſtinctiue ſignes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</note> firſt, that moſt friuolous is that reaſon of yours y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the going to the ſeruice of heretickes was lawfull before the ſtatute of going to the Church, and no diſtinctiue ſigne at all: and thence you conclude, that neither it can now be a diſtinctiue ſigne, wher as temporal Princes cannot giue the nature of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſigne of Religion, vnto any exteriour actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is not ſuch of it ſelfe.

               <p>But I perceiue the cauſe of your errour in this argument, to be the diſſention betweene Caietane and the reſt of the Deuines. Caietane ſaieth that if a Prince or a law amongſt Infidells,<note place="margin">in 2.2. q. 3. ar. 2. Whether a Prince may make a ſigne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctiue the omiſſion wherof may be a mortall ſinac</note> doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, that euery Chriſtian weare a certaine kind of garment, different from the reſt of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as a redd or yellow cappe: ſuch lawe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundment may be in two reſpectes: either for the proteſtation of religion, that the Prince inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth onely to know theire religion therby: or elſe for a politicke diſtinction, that a Chriſtian may be knowen from an Infidell, for the peaceable order of the common welth, and by ſuch marke be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as it were infamous. Of theſe two caſes he geueth a different cenſure. For in the firſt, that is, when the Prince intendeth to know euery mans faith and religion, although the ſame Prince inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth therby to take occaſion of perſecuting the Chriſtians: he ſaieth, that it is a mortall ſinne to omitt ſuch garment for than (as he ſaieth) euery one is virtually, and in effect interrogated of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which than he is bound to confeſſe. In the ſecond, he ſaieth that a man may lawfully omitt ſuch a ſigne, eſpecially for to ſaue his life, wheras
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:283:74"/>ſuch law doth not bind in daunger of life, being onely a politicke and ciuill law, for the peaceable gouernment of the ſtate, not in reſpect of religion.<note place="margin">What Caie tane think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the omiſſion of a ſigne of trew reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Prince of a falſe religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Therfore he concludeth that if a Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt Infidells ſhould be commaunded to weare a redd cappe, onely for ciuill pollicy, leaſt any tumulte ſhould ariſe or diſorder in the common wealth, by diuerſities of religions, than in daunger of death, and with leſſe daunger alſo he may without mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſinne omitt that ſigne: As a Iew at Rome, or at Venice, for to auoide the officer which cometh to arreſt him, may without deadly ſinne caſt off his Iewes cappe, that he may not be knowen; yea although his religion were the onely trew religion of the world. For ſuch ſigne is not ordained for the proteſtation of his religion, but onely for ciuill pollicy. But if the end of ſuch law were onely to proteſt religion, and that the Prince intended ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to knowe Chriſtians, for to puniſh them for their religion, and not to make onely a ciuill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, for the peaceable gouernment of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Infidells: than to omitt ſuch ſigne is a mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall ſinne, againſt the confeſſion of faith, which alwaies is neceſſary when a man is interrogated: euen as he is now (as it were, in effect) interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the law or commaundment of the Prince. Thus doth Caietane diſcourſe of the omiſſion of the ſigne of a Chriſtian vſed amongſt Infidells.<note place="margin">Caietanes opinion of the vſe of a ſigne of a falſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But now let vs alſo ſee (for it maketh much for the vnderſtanding of the wholle matter, and there is great difference) what he ſaieth of the vſurping of the ſigne of an Infidell, either when Infidells liue in a Chriſtian common wealth, as Iewes at
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:283:75"/>Rome; or whan Chriſtians liue in an Infidell com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon wealth, as among the Turkes. Than, ſaieth Caietane, although there be a ſigne appointed for an Infidell onely for ciuill reſpectes of temporall peace: yet is it a mortall ſinne, for a Chriſtian eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time which he vſeth the ſame. So that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian at Rome wearing a Iewes cappe, or amongſt the Turkes a white Turbant, doth euery time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte a mortall ſinne, although it were for to ſaue his life: for he than ſheweth him ſelfe a Iewe or Turke, by vſing the ſigne of either of them.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee Caietanes opinion is,<note place="margin">Marke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a ſigne of falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and omitting a ſigne of true religion.</note> that a man may neuer vſe a ſigne of a falſe religion, although appointed by the Prince: but that he may omitte the ſigne of his owne religion, when it is not inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for a proteſtation of religion: but when it is ordained as a ſigne of religion, than cannot hee omitte it without mortall ſinne.</p>
               <p>This doctrine by all other Deuines for the moſt parte is thought to rigorous. And they teach very well,<note place="margin">Bannes. 2.2. q. 3. ar. 2.</note> that a ſigne of an Infidell, ordained for ciuill reſpectes onely, may lawfully be vſed by a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in time of neceſſity, and whan there is no ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall. neither is there is ſuch vſe, any ſignification of religion iuſtly geuen,<note place="margin">Other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane.</note> but onely permitted. Euen as a lay man may weare a religious mans ordinary apparell, or a man a womans gowne for a good end, or for neceſſity, and yet not make any lye at all in the outward ſhew: but vſing that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> hath an other end beſides the ſignification; permitt the behoulders to thinke him, to be either a freer or a woman, which in deed he is not. As alſo Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Captaines in warre often times for policy vſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:283:75"/>Turkes banners: and Prieſtes among heretickes, lay apparell: and neuer are reprehended by any deuoute conſcience, for lying or diſſembling, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in religion, or in their particuler eſtate.</p>
               <p>In like maner the ſame Deuines doe teach againſt Caietane, that a man may lawfully omitte a ſigne of a Chriſtian where it is appointed, whan by any neceſſity he is vrged therunto. and they yeld a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for that ſuch Princes cannot preſcribe vnto vs by what ſignes we ſhall proteſt our faith.</p>
               <p>Here Sir, was that with which you were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For although Caietane be worthely iudged, to haue bene too ſeueere: yet againſt this action of going to hereticall ſcruice, togither with Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, doe all other Deuines geue theire graue and moſt deſerued verditte.<note place="margin">Diuerſe kindes of ſignes or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For they diſtinguiſh in theſe matters, whether they be garmentes, or other actions; diuerſe kinds. The firſt is, when ſome ſpeciall garmentes or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are proper onely to a certaine nation, which is hereticall, Iewiſh, or Turkiſh; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> not in that they be of ſuch religion,<note place="margin">Aſigne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctiue of religion in reſpect of the nation</note> but in that the common vſe of their countrey, hath brought into practiſe, ſuch particuler cuſtome. Such are the diuerſe banners of ſeuerall countreis, and the manifolde faſhions of apparell, which in euery countrey we ſee to be moſt in vſe. and in this kind there is no difficulty but any man may vſe ſuch garments or ſignes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as well as the proper tongue of the countrey,<note place="margin">Aſigne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctiue in reſpect of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill Pollicy</note> for any lawfull aduantage.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree is when not onely in reſpect of the countrey, but particulerly, for to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of religion, ſuch garment is preſcribed or
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:283:76"/>vſed: And if ſuch preſcription or cuſtome be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought in for humane policy of ciuill gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although withall there were a purpoſe of puniſhing or afflicting Chriſtians therby: yett if there be ſome ciuill or honeſt humane vſe of the ſame beſides the ſignification of hereſie, Iudaiſme, Turkiſme, or other ſorte of Infidelity and Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy: In vrgent caſe of neceſſity it may alſo be vſed lawfully by a Chriſtian, as we haue ſaide before. and it ſeemeth very reaſonable, for that a Turke newly conuerted to Chriſt, were not in any mans iudgement bound vnder mortall ſinne, preſently to caſt away his white Turbant and ſo to betraye him ſelfe: for in thoſe countreis a ſigne of a Turke is a white Turbant on his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third degree, is whan ſuch garment or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is beſides the ciuill vſe thereof,<note place="margin">A ſigne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctiue in repect of religion, yet hauing a prophane vſe for the principall end</note> (which is the principall end) referred vnto a ceremonious ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in euery religion. As amongſt Catholicks, a corner cappe, a Freers weede, eating of white meates, and not fleſhe vppon a friday. Amongſt other ſectes a miniſters apparell, an Idolatrous Preiſtes ordinary and prophane garment. And in this degree alſo they ſay, that wheras theſe thinges haue of them ſelues a good and conuenient vſe for the life of man, and the principall end of them is an honeſt humane vſe, not a religious ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (neither trewly is a Freers weed, although it ſignifie a Freer, ſo religiouſe as a Surpleſſe, Cope, Tunicle, or ſuch like, whoſe principall and onely end is religion:) wheras alſo the common practiſe of mans life hath as it were by a long preſcription obtained, that ſuch thinges in time of danger may
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:283:76"/>be vſed, for their ciuill end, not regarding their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſignification: it ſhall be lawfull for to ſaue a mans life, or for other neceſſary and important good, to weare a corner cappe, or Freers weed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe holy ſignes were vſed in a falſe and deteſtable religion: Alſo to eate fleſh on a friday, to putte on a miniſters, or Purſeuants apparell, or ſuch like. Neither were a miniſter vnder paine of mortall ſinne, preſently bound to put of his cloake or Ierkin after his conuerſion, nor a Purſeuant to throwe away his dreadfull badge; which he ſhold neceſſarily doe, if it were a mortall ſinne to vſe the ſame.</p>

Vnto this place and lodgeing muſt I of neceſſity vſſher your ſelfe, and all your companions. whoſe action of going to the ſeruice of hereticks (as I haue proued before) hath as intrinſecall a ſignification of hereſy and ſchiſme, as the deuoute going of a Catholickc to Maſſe in a catholicke congregation, hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Catholicke faith, and of Catholicke vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and religion. yet is it here to be noted that as in wordes, which haue the principall place amongſt ſignes of the minde and affection of man, there may ſometimes be themateriall vſe or ſuppoſition thereof, without the formall, as the Logicioners
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:283:78"/>teach: So there may alſo be in any action, which ſignifieth religion. An example we brought aboue of one which did onely relate the diſloiall wordes ſpoken of Auguſtus: who onely vſed thoſe words materially, without any formall ſignification ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of on his parte. So alſo did we bring an example before of a materiall ve of ſignes and ceremonies of religion, whan we according to the common doctrine of Deuines affirmed, that the materiall ſhew of Idolatry in a play or Comedy, was not of it ſelfe vnlawfull. Yet notwithſtanding as we ſaye that Sacrifice vnto Idolls, and contumelious ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches vnto his Prince are of them ſelues vnlawfull: So doe we ſay of ſignes of religion, namely of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church. For we alwaies take ſuch acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the formall therof: which is the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. which whan it is to be thought preſent or abſent, the common eſtimation of men muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide by the conſideration of time, perſon, place, and ſuch like. And ſo wee ſay that going to the Church in an orderly maner as it is vſed in our cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trey, cannot be voide by all mens eſtimation of ſignification of hereſy, and of contempt of verety, as hath bene proued</p>
               <p>Than doe I conclude that the graue cenſure of Deuines condemning Caietanes opinion as too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere,<note place="margin">Why Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is thought too rigorouſe</note> connot be vnderſtood of theſe expreſſe and poſitiue ſignes of a contrary religion, but of the omiſſion onely of a ſigne of a trew religion. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reaſon is manifeſt. For a man is not bound alwaies to profeſſe his religion, but in time and place: yet is he bound in no time or place to deny his religion. So may a man omitte a ſigne of his
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:283:78"/>religion, when he is not expreſly interrogated: but he cannot, neither beeing asked, nor without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, vſe a ceremoniouſe ſigne of a contrary religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without a moſt greeuous mortall ſinne. See than how you are deceiued whileſt you argue in this maner. If the Prince doe commaund me to weare a yellow cappe for proteſtation of my trew religion, I ſhall not deny my faith by leauing it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince cannot make a yellow cappe a ſigne of religion: Therfore if the Prince command me to go to the Church of heretickes, for ſigne of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity and adherency vnto his religion: I ſhall not deny my faith by doing it, becauſe he cannot make going to his Church a ſign eof his religion. Surely, Sir, he needeth not to make it a ſigne of his religion. for nature it ſelfe and the conſent of all nations, &amp; the iudgements of all men, not affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from their reaſonable vnderſtanding by terrour of hereticall perſecution: hath made it ſo already. And if you ſhould remaine in Bocardo vntill you had proued this conſequence, and reduced it to any lawfull moode or figure, you ſhould neuer come forth aliue.<note place="margin">A great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a ſigne of trew &amp; of falſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> That I may ſaye nothing of the difference betweene a ſigne of trewe &amp; of falſe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For the trew religion may be proteſted onely by ceremonies ordained by God and his Church: And therfore a temporall Prince cannot make a proteſtatiue ſigne therof. But as a falſe religion may be by a temporall Prince inſtituted and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed: ſo may the ceremonies, and proteſtations, and diſtinctiue ſignes therof be framed alſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his peculier imagination.

Neither doe I thinke any ſo wiſe, as to make that a generall ſigne of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke religion and vnity.</p>
               <p>Lett this than be our finall concluſion in this pointe,<note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this wholle laſt diſcourſe.</note> that although an Infidell Prince cannot make vs determinate ſignes of proteſtation of our onely trew religion, yett may hee make proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſignes of his owne Religion; which cannot be practiſed without mortall ſinne: as we ſee in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery falſe religion to be in vſe.

But that he worthely graunted it vnto that countrey: I doe nothing doubte: wheras it was ſo expedient to allure the ignorant people to the ſeruices of the Church almoſt growen altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of theire remembrance and liking.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> But we muſt neceſſarily make ſome diſtinction of diuerſe manners of praying with hereticks. The firſt manner is, whan they pray with vs, but Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickly, that is either in a Catholicke congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or elſe priuately, but yet after a Catholicke forme and manner, which maketh ſuch ceremony not to be accounted as an hereticall ceremony, but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:283:89"/>rather as Catholicke. So that here I doe not ſo much ſhew my ſelfe to communicate with the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke, as he to communicate with me. This was accounted in the auncient Church alwaies vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: vntill the Councèll of Conſtance and decree of Martinus the fifth. For this degree of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication being not of it ſelfe vnlawfull, neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying any deniall or contempte of religion, nor v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the hereticke in his diuiſion: as it was iuſtly forbidden at the firſt: ſo for the auoiding of many ſcandalls and daungers it was permitted after, as we lately ſaied. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond maner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with heretickes in praier, is when we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with them in their proper Churches: or if in priuate houſes, yet after their owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler forme and maner. And this was that which Origen refuſed. And although hee woulde no doubt haue refuſed alſo the firſt communication, as than being vnlawfull, according vnto auncient Canons than in force: yet was hee by Euſebius iudgement thought in refuſing this ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, to haue ſhewed his Catholicke faith, which he ſhould haue denied if he had donne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. This ſecond kind of praying with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, is in it ſelfe vnlawfull. For it importeth a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler vnion and aſſociation in that, in which they haue cutte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues from the houſe of DAVID, and erected a new Aultar, &amp; faſhioned new calues and new Gods, beſides him which cannot be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhiped but in the trew ſpirituall Hieruſalem. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third kind of communication with heretickes in praiers, is to receaue their baptiſme or ſacrifice, of whatſoeuer maner it be, or any kind of trew or
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:283:89"/>counterfaite Sacrament. And this is in the higheſt degree of ſpirituall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with them, alwaies vnlawfull, and moſt deteſtable, as alſo the ſecond: although ſomewhat in a greater meaſure of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
               <p>Theſe three degrees, you ſhall now ſee plainly ſet downe, in three Canons of the Apoſtles: where by the diuerſe puniſhments contained, you may iudge of the greuouſnes of euery one.</p>
               <p>The 44 Canon hath thus. A Biſhopp, Prieſt,<note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Apoſtles</note> or Deacon, which ſhall ioine prarers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hereticks: lett him be onely ſuſpended from Communion. But if alſo hee permitte them to doe any thing as Clerks: lett him be depoſed.</p>
               <p>In the 63 Canon ſo we read. If any Clearke, or lay man enter into the Sinagogue of the Iewes, or conuenticle of hereticks, that he may ioine prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with them: lett him be depoſed and excluded from the Communion.</p>
               <p>Finally, this is the 45 Canon. The Biſhoppe or Prieſt which hath taken the baptiſme or ſacrifice of heretickes, we commaund to be depoſed. For what agreement is there betweene Chriſt and Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? or what portion is there vnto a faithfull, with an Infidell? <g ref="char:leaf">❧</g>
               </p>
               <p>Where although it pleaſed the holy Apoſtles to impoſe ſometimes puniſhments vpon the Clergy onely, as which of dewty ſhould be the forme of the flocke: yet doth both their reaſon, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Church, ſhew the thing to be vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to euery faithfull Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>But here you very ſubtelly reply, that it is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into heretickes Churches for that intent of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:283:90"/>praier, which is condemned in the 63 Canoni: not the onely comming without any praier at all. Nay Sir: that is no good gloſſe. For the 44 Canon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a ſmaller penance for praying with them, and that only to ſome degrees of the Clergy. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, here is ſomething more than praying with them forbidden. and what is that, but going to their conuenticles? which going, becauſe they will diſtinguiſh from that going which may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lawfull, they call it going for to pray. And it is alwaies vnderſtood that one goeth for to pray, whan he is orderly preſent, at the time of praier. Neither can mans iudgement, which ſearcheth not the harte, eſteeme otherwiſe. Neither did euer the cuſtome of the Church (according to the politicke and new deuiſed intentions) interpret the preſence of a man at ſeruice or Maſſe, but as a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in praier. For which cauſe good Catholickes were alwaies bounde to auoide the Chappell or Church whan any exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate perſon in none of the tollerable degrees ſhewed before, entered in. Which if he did not, he reputed him ſelfe to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated with him in praier:<note place="margin">Nauar. c. 27 n. 20. The 4.

               <p>I could here very much dilate this diſcourſe, in the rehearfall of diuerſe examples of moſt conſtant Catholickes,<note place="margin">Victor vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis.</note> whom in the perſecution of the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalles in Africke hereticall ſury, made moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe mirrours, for whoſoeuer in our age hath to contend w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the like barbarouſnes.<note place="margin">Athenage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras in Apol Theoph.

               <p>I ſay therfore that it is not lawfull, but rather a thing hauing annexed vnto it, many of thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities we ſpake of before, to be preſent at the ſeruice of Schiſmaticks. I meane whan they haue once deuided them ſelues, and, made a ſeuerall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; or as the thirteth Canon of the Apoſtles and all auncient Fathers are wont to ſpeake, haue erected an other Aultar.

By reaſon and diſcourſe, this hath bene alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proued. But by the autority of the Church, we may aduouch it,<note place="margin">This may be deduced out of the thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. 2. waies.</note> in two waies. Firſt, for that in the alleaged Fathers and Councells, there is often times mention made not onely of heretickes, but of Schiſmatickes alſo: as in the Antiochen and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicean Councell and others. Secondly, becauſe many heretickes haue nothing differed from the trew Catholike Church in ſeruice or Sacraments, as ordinarily happened in the Primitiue Church. Wherupon I inferre, that not the ſeruice, but the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:283:97"/>vnion and participating with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,<note place="margin">Trew Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes damnable out of the Church.</note> is by the Fathers reproued, whan they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally teach to auoide heretickes ſeruice. So doe the Fathers allow Chriſtes Sacramentes, as ſufficient, euen amongſt heretickes and ſchiſmatickes: whan there concurreth the neceſſary matter, fourme, and intention, and the conuenient miniſter.<note place="margin">l. 2. cont ep Parm. c. 13 diſt. 32. c. praeter hoc. Conc. Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerd. c 13. Sending In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to Chriſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> Yet doth S. Auguſtine plainly teach, that ſuch Sacraments cannot ordinarily be either geuen or taken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne. Wherfore it was reputed in all ages ſo hainous a crime to cauſe a child to be chriſtned by an hereticke (although in the dew forme) that an auncient Councell made this decree. Lett not the oblation of that Catholicke in any wiſe be receiued in the Church, who ſhall offer his children to be baptiſed in hereſy.<g ref="char:leaf">❧</g>
               </p>
               <p>So doe the Fathers of the 7 generall Councell determine,<note place="margin">Act 1. 1. q. 7. c. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
